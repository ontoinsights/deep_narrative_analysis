  :definition "From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Populism&oldid=1016524972), Populism is 'an ideology which presents 'the people' as a morally good force and contrasts them against 'the elite', who are portrayed as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how 'the people' are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present 'the elite' as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing their own interests, and often the interests of other groups—such as large corporations, foreign countries, or immigrants—above the interests of 'the people'. Populist parties and social movements are often led by charismatic or dominant figures who present themselves as the 'voice of the people'. According to the ideational approach, populism is often combined with other ideologies, such as nationalism, liberalism, or socialism. Thus, populists can be found at different locations along the left–right political spectrum, and there exist both left-wing populism and right-wing populism.'" .

  rdfs:label "Progressivism" ;
  :definition "From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Progressivism&oldid=10180432732), Progressivism promotes 'social reform [b]ased on the idea of progress in which advancements in science, technology, economic development and social organization are vital to the improvement of the human condition ... The contemporary common political conception of progressivism emerged from the vast social changes brought about by industrialization in the Western world in the late-19th century. Progressives take the view that progress is being stifled by vast economic inequality between the rich and the poor; minimally regulated laissez-faire capitalism with monopolistic corporations; and the intense and often violent conflict between those perceived to be privileged and unprivileged, arguing that measures were needed to address these problems. The meanings of progressivism have varied over time and from different perspectives. Early-20th century progressivism was tied to eugenics and the temperance movement, both of which were promoted in the name of public health and as initiatives toward that goal. Contemporary progressives promote public policies that they believe will lead to positive social change. In the 21st century, a movement that identifies as progressive is 'a social or political movement that aims to represent the interests of ordinary people through political change and the support of government actions'.'" .

As an adjective, the word reactionary describes points of view and policies meant to restore a past status quo. The word reactionary is often used in the context of the left–right political spectrum, and is one tradition in right-wing politics. In popular usage, it is commonly used to refer to a highly traditional position, one opposed to social or political change. However, according to political theorist Mark Lilla, a reactionary yearns to overturn a present condition of perceived decadence and recover an idealized past. Such reactionary individuals and policies favour social transformation, in contrast to conservative individuals or policies that seek incremental change or to preserve what exists in the present.'" .
