The ovoid fruit is 2 - 5cm long. The purple or red-skinned fruits are considered to have a superior flavour to white forms. Seed - raw or cooked. A delicious flavour. They are roasted and eaten. When preserving the fruits, they are pierced right through the centre, including the seed. This allows the juice of the fruit to penetrate the seed and, after separation from the shell, the nut-like kernel is eaten. An edible oil can be extracted from the seed."@en ;

They are used externally as a wash to treat skin complaints. The juice of the roots and leaves, mixed with oil, is used to contract the sphincters of the vulva by women wishing to simulate virginity, and the same preparation is used by men for treating flaccid scrotum."@en ;

Agroforestry Uses: Plants can be grown as a hedge. They are particularly well suited for use by the sea. The plant often forms large, rambling, impenetrable thickets and so it has been used to stabilize sand dunes. Other Uses: An oil can be obtained from the seed The seeds are so rich in oil that they can be strung on sticks and burnt like a candle. The bark is rich in tannins. A black dye can be obtained from the fruit. A black dye can be obtained from the leaves."@en .

  :plant_medicinal_text "The bark and roots are used medicinally as a purgative and against a variety of ailments."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The shrubs have an extensive, deep root system that holds the soil and so can be used in schemes to prevent soil erosion. The tree produces large amounts of litter and recycles appreciable quantities of nutrients through its deep root system, whilst its dense canopy aids in weed suppression. It has shown promise as mulch and soil regenerator because of its slow decomposition rate. The stems provide good quality poles for staking yams and for construction. The tree is planted in hedgerows in a traditional alley cropping system with inter-hedgerow spacing of 2 - 3 metres and with 1 - 2 years of cropping followed by 3 - 4 years of fallow. Following the fallow period, the shrubs are underbrushed and burned and stems cut to a height of 10 - 20cm. Some stems are left uncut for live staking of Guinea yam (Dioscorea cayenensis). Crops are then interplanted in the alleys. Other Uses: The dark red wood is hard, durable and resistant to termite attack. The stems provide good quality poles for staking crops and are also used for construction work. The wood is used for fuel."@en .

It is used in making paint, varnish, soap etc. The twigs are used as chew sticks to keep teeth and gums clean and healthy. The pale-brown to yellow-red wood is hard, durable and heavy, but is high in silica making it somewhat difficult to saw and plane. It is strongly fire resistant. A locally important wood, it is very suitable for fine woodwork, building and furniture making, and is also used for poles, dugout canoes and mortars. The wood is used for fuel and makes a good charcoal."@en .
