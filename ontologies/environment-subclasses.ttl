# File defining semantics related to specific factors or situations related

# physical environment (sub-classes of EnvironmentAndCondition).
# 
# These subclasses should be extended as needed for a domain of interest.

# Changes:
#  Reset change history and simplified
#  Simplified the EconomicEnvironment hierarchy by removing subclasses
#    such as SavingsAndInvestment that are better captured as Measurements
#  Removed CaptivityAndDetention as its semantics are similar to 
#    ArrestAndImprisonment
#  Clarified semantics by adding "Access" to several class names
#  Added Culture and LaborRelated

Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sunâ€™s heat and raising temperatures.'"@en ;

High vapor pressure correlates with a low boiling point, which relates to the number of the sample's molecules in the surrounding air, a trait known as volatility...

:WaterScarcity a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :EnvironmentalIssue ;
  rdfs:label "Water Scarcity"@en ;
  rdfs:comment "From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Water_scarcity&oldid=1054040280), WaterScarcity '(closely related to water stress or water crisis) is the lack of fresh water resources to meet the standard water demand. Two types of water scarcity have been defined: physical or economic water scarcity. Physical water scarcity is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid areas (for example Central and West Asia, and North Africa) often suffer from physical water scarcity. On the other hand, economic water scarcity is caused by a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers, aquifers, or other water sources, or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. Much of Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by economic water scarcity. The essence of global water scarcity is the geographic and temporal mismatch between fresh water demand and availability... The main driving forces for the rising global demand for water are the increasing world population, improving living standards, changing consumption patterns (for example a dietary shift toward more animal products), and expansion of irrigated agriculture. Climate change (including droughts or floods), deforestation, increased water pollution and wasteful use of water can also cause insufficient water supply. Scarcity varies over time as a result of natural hydrological variability, but varies even more so as a function of prevailing economic policy, planning and management approaches. Scarcity can be expected to intensify with most forms of economic development'."@en ;
