Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) compared herself to former President Abraham Lincoln during her concession speech shortly after her loss to Trump-backed Republican challenger Harriet Hageman.

Cheney claimed she lost her primary election only because she failed to “go along with President Trump’s lie about the 2020 election.”

“It would have required that I enable his ongoing efforts to unravel our democratic system and attack the foundations of our republic. That is a path I could not and would not take,” Cheney said.

Cheney said her opposition to former President Donald Trump was rooted in “the principles” that members of congress are sworn to protect and that she “well understood the potential political consequences” of opposing Trump.

She then compared herself to Lincoln, who saved the nation during our Civil War.
