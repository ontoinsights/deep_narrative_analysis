    f'{chatgpt} You are a political observer analyzing news articles. Here is the text ' + \
    'of a narrative or article (ending with the string "**" which should be ignored): {narr_text} **' + \
    f'Here is a numbered list of the possible goals of the narrative. {narrative_goals_text} ' \
    f'Indicate the numbers of the 2 most likely narrative goals. Also, summarize the article, and explain ' + \
    f'how it would be interpreted from each of the following perspectives: {interpretation_views}. Rank the ' \
    f'text from 1-5 as to how positively it would be received by readers of each perspective. The rank of 1 is ' \
    f'very negatively, and the rank of 5 is very positively. Lastly, indicate the article sentiment ("positive", ' \
    f'"negative" or "neutral"), and explain why that sentiment was selected. Return the response as a JSON object ' \
    f'with keys and values as defined by {narrative_summary_result}.'

# Sentence-level prompting
sentence_prompt = \
    f'{chatgpt} You are a linguist and NLP expert, analyzing the text from narratives and news articles. ' + \

    '{sent_text} ** Indicate the grade level that is expected of a reader to understand the sentence semantics. ' \

    f'{rhetorical_devices_text} Provide the numbers associated with the devices found in the sentence and ' \
    f'explain why they are identified. If there are no rhetorical devices used, return an empty array for ' \
    f'the "rhetorical_devices" JSON key. Also return a short summary of the sentence in 15 words or less. ' \
    'Return the sentence as specified in the article as the summary, if it is 15 words or less. ' + \
    f'Return the response as a JSON object with keys and values defined by {sentence_result}.'

# Validating Wikipedia result
wikipedia_prompt = \
    f'{chatgpt} You are a student researching a proper noun and are given its text and information ' + \
    'that the noun is a type of "{text_type}". You retrieved a possible definition for the ' \
    'noun from Wikipedia. That definition is given by the following text, ending with the string "**" ' \
    'which should be ignored. {wiki_def} **. Evaluate if the definition is ' \
    'consistent with the noun type, and return the response as a JSON object with keys and ' + \
    f'values as defined by {consistency_result}.'
