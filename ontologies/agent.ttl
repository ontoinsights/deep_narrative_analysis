  rdfs:label "Affiliation" ;
  :definition "An Affiliation defines the (typically) long-term association of an Agent (the :affiliated_agent) or Location, to another entity such as a OrganizationalEntity or GeopoliticalEntity. The individual to whom/which the Agent or Location is associated is identified using the :affiliated_with property, while the time of the Affiliation can be specified using the :has_time property (or its subproperties) and the role that the Agent or Location 'plays' is defined by the :has_role or :role properties. Another possibility to defining an Agent's role is to use the :role datatype property. This permits the capture of the role in the specific text/vocabulary of the narrative, whereas the :has_role property maps that text to an enumerated value." ;
