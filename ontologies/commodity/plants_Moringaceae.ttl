  :plant_edible_text "Young leaves and shoots - raw or cooked. Added to salads, cooked as a potherb and added to soups and curries. They have a mustard-like flavour. The leaves contain 7 - 10% protein. (This almost certainly refers to the dried leaf.) The leaves are very nutritious, being rich in vitamins, minerals and the sulphur-containing amino acids methionine and cystine, which are often in short supply. The young, tender seedlings make an excellent cooked vegetable. Flowers - raw or cooked. Added to salads, cooked as a potherb and added to soups and curries. They can also be used to make a tea. Seedpods. The long, bean-like pods are used in soups and curries, or made into pickles. The young pods are said to have a taste reminiscent of asparagus and can be eaten raw. The pods can be 15 - 45cm long. Seeds. The immature seeds are eaten like peas. A sweet flavour. Mature seeds, when roasted or fried, are said to resemble peanuts in flavour. An oil obtained from the seeds is used in salads and cooking. Pleasantly flavoured, it resembles olive oil and is an excellent salad oil. The oil is clear and odourless and does not become rancid quickly. The seeds from mature pods (which can be 40-50 cm long) are browned in a skillet, mashed and placed in boiling water, which causes the oil to float to the surface. The pungent root is used like horseradish (Armoracea rusticana) as a hot flavouring in foods. Even when free of the bark, the condiment when used in excess may be harmful. A reddish gum obtained from the bark is used as a seasoning. Used in a similar manner to gum tragacanth."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The horseradish tree is a nutritious, diuretic, laxative herb that is expectorant, increases milk flow, controls bacterial infections and is rubefacient when applied topically. It contains a potent antibiotic. Ben oil, obtained from the seeds, has no taste, smell or colour and is exceptionally resistant to oxidation. The young leaves are taken internally to increase the milk flow in nursing mothers. The root is used as a vesicant. The alkaloid spirachin (a nerve paralyzer) has been found in the roots. The root juice is used internally in the treatment of asthma, gout, rheumatism, enlarged spleen and liver, bladder and kidney stones, inflammatory conditions. Externally, the root is used to treat boils, ulcers, glandular swellings, infected wounds, skin diseases, dental infections, snake bites and gout. The roots and bark are used for cardiac and circulatory problems, as a tonic and for inflammation. The bark is an appetizer and digestive. The gum is demulcent, diuretic, astringent and abortifacient. It is used in cough syrups and in the treatment of asthma. The bark and gum are used in the treatment of tuberculosis and septicaemia. Flowers and immature fruits are said to be a good rubefacient. A decoction of the flowers is used as a cold remedy. The seeds are effective against skin-infecting bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They contain the potent antibiotic and fungicide terygospermin. Oil of Ben is used for hysteria, scurvy, prostate problems and bladder troubles. A number of compounds with medicinal properties have been isolated. The fruit and leaf contain oxalic acid, the bark moringinine, the stem vanillin, the flower kaempferol and quercetin and the root spirochin and pterygospermin. The seeds contain a glucosinolate that on hydrolysis yields 4-(alpha-L-rhamnosyloxy)-benzylisothiocyanate, an active bactericide and fungicide."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Seaside tree. Flowering tree. Coastal street tree. Specimen. Xerophytic.  Agroforestry Uses: Plants can be grown as an informal hedge, providing wind protection, shade and support for climbing garden plants. Widely used for live fences and hedges in many areas. Stakes root easily and are stable, and cuttings planted in lines are used particularly around houses and gardens. Because its shade can be controlled well Moringa oleifera is suitable for planting in alley cropping and in vegetable gardens. When trees reach 1.5 metres, farmers prune them (at 50cm from the ground or at ground level for older ones) once or twice a year. In alley cropping, an intra-row spacing of 2 metres is used. In the wet season cereals are grown between the lines, in the dry season vegetables. Because the tree is fast growing and readily colonizes areas such as stream banks and savannah, it makes a very good pioneer species for establishing a woodland garden. It is able to provide food after just a few months and also providing shelter to help other plants to establish. Other Uses The oil obtained from the mature seed and pods, known as 'oil of ben', has been used to lubricate watches and other fine machinery. It is also used in perfumery, artist's paints, soaps and ointments. It is yellowish, non-drying, has good keeping qualities but eventually turns rancid. The powdered seeds are used to clarify sugar cane juice. A suspension of the ground seed is used as a primary coagulant. It can clarify water of any degree of visible turbidity. At high turbidity, its action is almost as fast as that of alum, but at medium and low turbidity, good clarification is obtained if a small cloth bag filled with the powdered seeds is swirled round in the turbid water. To prepare the seed for use as a coagulant, remove the seed coat and wings. The white kernel is then crushed to a powder, using a mortar or placing it in a cloth and crushing it with a stone. The powder should be mixed with a small amount of water, stirred, then poured through a tea strainer before being added to the turbid water. The seed cake residue from oil extraction can also be used for water purification. The seed contains a protein (cationic polyelectrolyte) that acts as a flocculant in water purification. It also contains a non-protein flocculant that is more effective in purifying low-turbidity water. The bark, when beaten, produces a fibre used to make small ropes and mats. A study on the production of rayon-grade pulp from M. Oleifera by a prehydrolyzed sulphate process in India shows that it is suitable as a raw material for the production of high alpha cellulose pulp for use in cellophane and textiles. When the tree is injured, the stem exudes a gum that is used in calico printing. The bark is used for tanning. The wood yields a blue dye. The crushed leaves are used to clean pots, pans and walls. The press cake left after oil extraction from the seeds can be used as a soil conditioner or as fertilizer. The wood is very soft, corky and light, and is useful only for light construction work. It is pulped as a source of rayon and cellophane. The soft and light wood burns smoke-free and is an acceptable firewood for cooking but makes poor charcoal. It has a density of 0.5-0.7 and yields approximately 4600 kcal/kg."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: A good bee plant. Other Uses: An oil obtained from the seed is used in cosmetics. Traditional methods to extract the oil, as used by the Bedouin, are very simple but yield little oil. The seeds are crushed, water is added and the seeds are boiled. The mixture is left overnight to allow the oil to float to the surface, from where it is skimmed off. In a more advanced method the seeds are crushed, some water is added and the mixture is gently heated for 10 - 15 minutes. The oil is then extracted using a screw press or hydraulic press. The seeds are used as coagulant to purify water. The water purifying properties of the seed are caused by a protein which coagulates dispersed particles. The seeds are ground to a paste, the paste is put in a bottle and water is added. The mixture is shaken for 5 minutes to activate the protein. The mixture is then sieved and the solution is added to turbid water. After slowly stirring for 20 minutes, fine particles including bacteria coagulate, sink and settle on the bottom. After one hour clear water can be drawn off. The wood is very succulent and therefore not used for construction. The wood is collected for fuel in the southern Sinai, but it has now become scarce."@en .

  :plant_edible_text "Young leaves - raw or cooked and eaten as a vegetable. A larger leaf with a milder flavour than the leaves of M. Oleifera. Traditionally, the leaflets are separated from the rachis and plunged into boiling water. Salt or sodium carbonate is added to the water. While the leaves are cooking, a mixture of flours is prepared, then kneaded and made into balls 2 - 5cm in diameter. These are tossed into the water as well and after about 10 minutes the balls and the leaves are ready to serve. The addition of fat (grease or butter), small-sized cereal balls and a large amount of leaves are considered to make this dish a good-quality meal. The young, soft fruits can also be added, but the slightly bitter taste restricts the use to periods when food is in short supply. Flowers - cooked and eaten as a vegetable. Seedpods - cooked. This probably refers to the young seedpods, as mentioned above, which have a bitter flavour."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "An infusion of the leaves is used as a remedy against leprosy. They are also used to treat hypertension, retained placenta, asthma, colds, as an anthelmintic, to induce vomiting and to promote wound healing. The leaves of certain trees of this species are renowned for their effectiveness against diarrhoea. The smoke of burning roots is used as a treatment for epilepsy. The smoke is said to be inhaled by women in Sudan during a difficult labour, but as the species has not been collected so far in Somalia, this record is probably incorrect. The leaves and roots are used as a cure for malaria, stomach problems and diabetes. The bark is chewed as a treatment against coughs, and is also used to make fortifying soups. Ethanol extracts of the leaves and roots have shown promise in control of Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania donovani in in-vitro experiments. The leaf extract causes increased uterine smooth muscle contractions. The medicinal use of leaves to expel a retained placenta may be related to these increased contractions. A crude seed extract strongly inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sp. And Candida albicans. An aqueous extract of the leaves has been found to lower blood glucose concentration although it was less potent than glibenclamide. The effect was observed to increase with time and with increasing dose of the extract."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The tree is used as a living fence. Although in cultivation the primary goal is vegetable production, the tree can also play a role in erosion control, as a live fence, as a windbreak, for shade and as a bee plant. Traditionally, the trees are mainly grown in home gardens of up to 0.1 ha with 5 - 15 trees per garden. Other crops usually grown in these gardens are papaya, coffee, banana, cassava, maize, sugar cane, cotton and Capsicum peppers. Other Uses The seeds of this species are very effective for water purification. The seed contains a protein (cationic polyelectrolyte) that acts as a flocculent in water purification. It can be extracted from the ground seed with salt water. Even very muddy water can be cleared when the crushed seeds are added. Solid matter and some bacteria will coagulate and then sink to the bottom of the container of water. The cleaned water can then be poured off and boiled. The seed oil is used as a lubricant, in perfumery and in soap production.. The wood is very soft and is useful for making paper. The wood makes low-grade firewood and poor-quality charcoal."@en .
