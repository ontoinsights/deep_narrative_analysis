It is in leaf from May to November, in flower in August, and the seeds ripen from September to October. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) and is pollinated by Insects.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil."@en ;
  :plant_edible_text "Leaves - occasionally cooked as a spinach but more commonly used as a flavouring in salads, fruit salads etc. A delicious lemon-like flavour, it is adored by most people who try it. A delicious and refreshing tea is made from the leaves. The dried leaves will retain their lemon aroma for many years."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "An undervalued medicinal herb, lemon verbena contains a strong lemon-scented essential oil that has calming and digestive qualities. The plant has a gentle sedative action and a reputation for soothing abdominal discomfort. It has a mildly tonic effect upon the nervous system and helps to lift the spirits and counter depression. The leaves and the flowering tops are antispasmodic, febrifuge, sedative and stomachic. A tea made from the leaves has a deliciously refreshing lemon flavour and is used mainly in treating digestive disorders such as flatulence, indigestion and acidity. Some caution is advisable though, since prolonged use or large internal doses can cause gastric irritation. The herb is also useful as a stimulant for treating lethargy or depression whilst it is also used to treat feverish colds. The essential oil is used in aromatherapy in the treatment of nervous and digestive problems and also for acne, boils and cysts."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "An essential oil obtained from the leaves is extensively used in perfumery. An average yield of 0.5% is obtained. There is some evidence that the use of this oil can sensitise the skin to sunlight and so its use has been largely replaced by the tropical plant lemongrass, Cymbopogon spp.. The dried leaves retain their fragrance well and so are used in pot-pourri. The growing plant repels midges, flies and other insects. The essential oil is an effective insecticide in 1 - 2% concentration."@en .

  :plant_medicinal_text "The plant is often used in domestic medicine and research carried out mainly in India has shown it to contain a number of compounds with medicinal activity. The leaves contain 0.2% of an essential oil. Extracts have shown antimicrobial, fungicidal, insecticidal and nematicidal activity. The dried flowers contain 0.07% essential oil comprised mainly of caryophyllene-like bicyclic terpene (80%) and l,a-phellandrene (10-12%). The bark contains lantanine, 0.08%. Verbascoside, which possesses antimicrobial, immunosuppressive and antitumor activities, has been isolated from the plant. Lantanoside, linaroside and camarinic acid have been isolated and are being investigated as potential nematocides. Lantana essential oil is sometimes used for the treatment of skin itches, as an antiseptic for wounds, and externally for leprosy and scabies. It is applied as a poultice on rheumatic joints. The root is sweet and bitter tasting, refrigerant, antifebrile. A decoction is used to treat influenza, cough, mumps, incessant high fever, malaria, cervical lymph node tuberculosis, asthma, toothache, headache, inflammation, gonorrhoea and leucorrhoea. The flowers are sweet tasting, mildly cooling and haemostatic. A decoction of the dried flowers is used in the treatment of haemoptysis and pulmonary tuberculosis. The leaves are aromatic with a minty taste, they have a cooling nature, are antiphlogistic, anti-dermatosic, diaphoretic, febrifuge, pectoral, stimulant, tonic and vulnerary. An infusion of the leaves and flowering tops is used in the treatment of fevers, constipation, tuberculosis, catarrh and bronchitis. Combined with the leaves of Cymbopogon citratus, they are used as an infusion to treat colds, high blood pressure and malarial fever. Externally, the leaves and stems are used as a wash to treat dermatitis, eczema, pruritus, measles and chickenpox rashes etc. They are applied as a poultice to treat sprains, wounds and contusions. As a douche, they are used to treat inflammations of the uterus. A decoction of the bark is used as a treatment for fevers."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The plant has an extensive root system and is often planted for erosion control. The plant responds well to trimming and is often grown as a hedge. The plant provides an abundance of organic matter which can be used as mulch material. Other Uses The use of lantana extracts as potential biocides has been suggested. For example, aqueous leachate at 1 - 3% can kill water hyacinth, a troublesome weed in many tropical countries. Its application as a herbicide would depend on the size of the waterbodies being treated and the cost of extraction of the leachate. The stems of lantana, if treated by the sulphate process, can be used to produce pulp for paper suitable for writing and printing. However it is hard to harvest, so is likely to be uneconomical. The roots of lantana contain a substance that may possibly be used for rubber manufacture, although the economic viability of production has not been examined. The plant is utilized as firewood. The twigs and stems serve as useful fuel for cooking and heating in many developing countries, although it is less important than other fuel sources such as windrows, woodlots or natural bush."@en .
