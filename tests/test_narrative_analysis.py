narr_text = \
    'For 35 years, I’ve devoted my professional life to U.S. peacemaking policy and conflict resolution and planning ' \
    '— whether in the former Soviet Union, a reunified Germany or postwar Iraq. But nothing has preoccupied me like ' \
    'finding a peaceful and lasting solution between Israel and the Palestinians. In the past, I might have favored ' \
    'a cease-fire with Hamas during a conflict with Israel. But today it is clear to me that peace is not going to ' \
    'be possible now or in the future as long as Hamas remains intact and in control of Gaza. Hamas’s power and ' \
    'ability to threaten Israel — and subject Gazan civilians to ever more rounds of violence — must end. After ' \
    'Oct. 7, there are many Israelis who believe their survival as a state is at stake. That may sound like an ' \
    'exaggeration, but to them, it’s not. If Hamas persists as a military force and is still running Gaza after ' \
    'this war is over, it will attack Israel again. And whether or not Hezbollah opens a true second front from ' \
    'Lebanon during this conflict, it, too, will attack Israel in the future. The aim of these groups, both of ' \
    'which are backed by Iran, is to make Israel unlivable and drive Israelis to leave: While Iran has denied ' \
    'involvement in the Hamas attack, Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, has long talked about Israel not ' \
    'surviving for another 25 years, and his strategy has been to use these militant proxies to achieve that goal.'

    #      has worked on various international conflicts. The focus is on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
    #      specifically the role of Hamas in Gaza. The author argues that peace is unattainable as long as
    #      Hamas, which is backed by Iran, remains in power and poses a threat to Israel. The narrative
    #      suggests that for Israelis, the existence of their state is at risk, and that the ultimate goal
    #      of Hamas and Hezbollah is to make Israel unlivable.",
