It is widely used in Western herbal medicine where it is seen as a balancing herb for the female reproductive system and has proved to be a beneficial remedy for menstrual problems and ovarian cysts - it can also be of help in the menopause. The root is adaptogen, diuretic, emetic, uterine tonic and vermifuge. Small doses of the dried and powdered root are used. It is employed in the treatment of amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea and leucorrhoea and also for a variety of ailments associated with the male and female reproductive organs.
