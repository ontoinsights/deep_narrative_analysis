The texture is fine; the grain straight or interlocked, sometimes wavy. The wood is very hard, very heavy, elastic, and very durable, resisting water well and resistant to fungal and insect attack, particularly termites and marine borers. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of distortion and checking; once dry it is moderately stable in service. The wood has a fairly high blunting effect upon tools, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide are recommended; it polishes well; is easy to work, but has the disadvantage of being liable to shake and crack; it takes nails and screws well so long as it is pre-bored; gluing is correct for interior use only. In great demand, the wood is used in turnery and as a substitute for mahogany, as well as for heavy carpentry, industrial flooring, piles for bridges and railway ties. The wood produces a suitable charcoal."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: In agroforestry trials in Peru, the best establishment and growth of this tree was observed where seedlings were mixed with plantains, or on the borders of the field where neighbouring taller vegetation provided partial shade. A comparison between individuals in agroforestry trials and those in natural forests found that larger DBHs were obtained in agroforestry at a given height and that diameter growth was also higher in agroforestry trees, showing that this species can establish and thrive under these conditions. Plants grown in these agroforestry trials flowered and fruited from the age of approximately 6 years, and the fertile periods in both the flood plain and terra firma trials coincided more or less with the pattern observed in natural flood plain forests. On the basis of the results from this it was concluded that without silvicultural measures to enhance the density and growth of Minqurtia guianensis, there is only a limited ability of natural flood plain forests to supply the wood of this species. Other Uses The fissured bark exudes a white latex when cut. The wood is fine-textured, irregular-grained, very heavy and almost impervious to rot. A valuable timber, it is very hard to cut but is much used for external purposes such as poles, posts etc. The wood is exceptionally durable and has been reported to have lasted 30 - 40 years in the ground without any signs of decay. It is resistant to attacks from fungus and termites. Because of this exceptional durability, it has been extracted for subsistence and commercial purposes, mainly for posts and poles in construction."@en .

  :plant_medicinal_text "The bark is laxative. The bark is used to treat enlargement of the spleen. The fresh bark is rubbed on the breasts of lactating mothers to purge their babies. Similarly, a decoction of the bark is used as a wash for babies, or they are given a pinch of pounded bark mixed with a little salt. The sap is used as styptic. The root and stem bark contain cyclohexanoid protaflavanones named ongokeins; they are related to sakuranetin and are characterized by a non-aromatic C6-ring moiety that is otherwise only known from certain ferns."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses The dry seed contains about 63% of a reddish yellow oil, thickening on exposure to air, with an unpleasant odour. Known as 'boleko oil' or 'isano oil', it is inedible but has a wide range of other uses. This oil differs from other vegetable oils in its fatty acid composition. It has a high iodine number, but it does not dry like linseed oil or tung oil do when exposed in a thin film. When heated to 250?c a strongly exothermic spontaneous polymerization reaction starts, which may lead to a further increase in temperature to more than 400?c and to an explosion. Traditionally, it is used to anoint the skin. It can also be used to make soap and to protect metal and wooden surfaces. The oil can be used to make de-emulsifying products for the crude oil extraction industry and for the prevention of icing-up of airplane wings. It can be vulcanized to yield highly resistant synthetic-rubber products. Polymerization at moderately high temperatures yields a film with remarkable properties: strong, flexible and insoluble in acid and alkaline solvents. This makes it suitable for manufacturing brake pads and linings. Ozonolytic cleavage can yield saturated double acids, which are used in the synthesis of polyamides. The use of fatty acids from boleko oil in the manufacturing of silicones and of isolating glue for lithium-based batteries has been patented. The oil can be used as an additive to linseed oil in the manufacture of paints, varnishes and linoleum. In association with linseed oil, the oil can be made into a standoil (a heat-polymerized oil, very thick and strongly adhesive, but slowly drying; used as a final coat in oil painting) of superior qualities. Boiling boleko oil with copal gives this resin a very high heat resistance. The fruits are used as spinning tops for children. The heartwood is pale yellow to pale brown, darkening on exposure to light; it is indistinctly demarcated from the 6 - 10 cm thick band of sapwood. The texture is fine and even; the grain is straight, sometimes finely interlocked or wavy. The wood is heavy; moderately hard to hard; durable - it is little affected by decay fungi or termites and is resistant to marine borers. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of distortion and a slight risk of checking; once dry it is moderately to poorly stable in service. The wood is easy to work with ordinary tools; it saws and planes with little blunting; is easy to finish, sand and polish; can be painted, varnished, waxed and glued without difficulty. For nailing preboring is often required. It can be sliced into veneer, but requires much force. The wood, called 'angueuk' in the trade, is used mostly locally in heavy construction, for railway sleepers and vehicle frames, in interior and exterior carpentry, for flooring, containers and boxes, turnery and veneer. It is well suited for interior joinery provided it is perfectly dry to avoid deformation."@en .

  :plant_medicinal_text "Muira Puama has a long history of medicinal use by the native peoples of the Amazon region. Many of these uses were adopted by the Europeans when they arrived in S. America and have subsequently been verified by modern research. The plant is commonly used in many areas of S. America, and this use is spreading to other areas of the world. The main plant chemicals found in muira puama include: alpha-copaene, alpha-elemene, alpha-guaiene, alpha-humulene, alpha-muurolene, alpha-pinene, alpha-resinic acid, alpha-terpinene, arachidic acid, allo-aromadendren, behenic acid, beta-bisabolene, beta-caryophyllene, beta-pinene, beta-resinic acid, beta-sitosterol, beta-transfarnesene, borneol, campesterols, camphene, camphor, car-3-ene, caryophyllene, cerotic acid, chromium, coumarin, cubebene, delta-cadinene, dotriacontanoic acid, elixene, ergosterols, eugenol, essential oils, gamma-muurolene, hentriacontanoic acid, heptacosanoic acid, lignoceric acid, limonene, linalool, lupeol, melissic acid, montanic acid, muirapuamine, myrcene, nonacosanoic acid, para-cymene, pentacosanoic acid, phlobaphene, stigmasterols, trichosanic acid, and uncosanic acid. One of the early studies into the plant showed that muira puama was effective in treating disorders of the nervous system and sexual impotence, and that ?permanent effect is produced in locomotor ataxia, neuralgias of long standing, chronic rheumatism, and partial paralysis.?. The benefits of treating impotence with muira puama have been studied in two human trials in France, which reported that muira puama was effective in improving libido and treating erectile dysfunction. In another study, muira puama extracts have been reported to have adaptogenic, antifatigue, antistress, and beneficial effects on the central nervous system. Researchers in Brazil have documented a definite central nervous system effect of the bark. The bark of muira puama also has demonstrated a mild, short-lived, hypotensive effect. The root was found to inhibit stress-induced ulcers. The leaf has demonstrated an analgesic effect. Brazilian researchers reported in 2003 that an alcohol extract of muira puama facilitated memory retrieval and noted it may be beneficial for Alzheimer's patients. Their next study published in 2004 reported that an alcohol extract of muira puama protected and increased the viability of brain cells (partly through an antioxidant effect) which may be beneficial for stroke victims. Traditionally, the stems and roots from young plants are used as a tonic to treat neuromuscular problems; a root decoction is used in baths and massages for treating paralysis and beriberi; whilst a root-and-bark tea is taken to treat sexual debility, rheumatism, influenza, and cardiac and gastrointestinal weakness. The plant is also valued there as a preventive for baldness. In modern herbalism, muira puama is a highly-regarded sexual stimulant with a reputation as a powerful aphrodisiac. It is used as a neuromuscular tonic to treat weakness and paralysis, dyspepsia, menstrual disturbances, sexual impotency, influenza, and central nervous system disorders. It is applied externally to treat chronic rheumatism. To achieve the libido and potency effects of this particular plant, proper preparation methods must be employed. The active constituents thought to be responsible for muira puama's potency and libido effect are not soluble in water - taking bark or root powder in capsules or tablets will not be effective because these chemical cannot be digested or absorbed. High heat for at least 20 minutes with alcohol is necessary to free the volatile and essential oils, terpenes, gums, and resins found in the bark and root which have been linked to muira puama's beneficial effects."@en ;
