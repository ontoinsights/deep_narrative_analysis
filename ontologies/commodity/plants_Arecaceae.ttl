The seed has mild narcotic properties, it is widely used in some areas of the tropics as a masticatory, being mixed with the leaves of a pepper plant (Piper betle), a gum and, often, lime. Betel seeds contain tannins and alkaloids - these stimulate saliva flow, accelerate heart and perspiration rates, suppress hunger and offer positive protection against intestinal worms. The ovoid fruit is 4 - 5cm long and produced in large clusters of 200 - 300. Young leaves, inflorescences and the sweet inner part of the shoots are cooked and eaten as vegetables. The skin of the fruit is edible. The nut contains 8-12% fat that has characteristics comparable with hydrogenated coconut oil. It can be made edible by refining it with an alkali."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "Betel palm is an astringent, stimulant herb that relieves hunger, abdominal discomfort and weariness. It kills intestinal parasites and other pathogens, and also has diuretic and laxative effects. It is used mainly in veterinary medicine to expel tapeworms. The seed is used against anaemia, fits, leucoderma, leprosy, obesity and worms. It is also used in the treatment of dysentery and malaria. In combination with other ingredients, it is also a purgative and an ointment for nasal ulcers. Kernels of green and mature fruits are chewed as an astringent and stimulant, often with the leaves or fruit of betel pepper (Piper betle) and slaked lime. The rind is also used as a laxative in cases of constipation with flatulence and bloating, as well as a diuretic in treating oedema. The fruits are harvested when fully ripe, and can be dried for later use. The areca nut decoction as well as arecoline and its salts have been found to be effective on various parasitic helminth infections such as those caused by Taenia spp."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: High (4/5). Agroforestry Uses: Experimental evidence indicates that intercropping with areca nut is not harmful to the main crop. When intercropped with black pepper, it acts as a live standard for training the pepper plants. Banana, cardamom, cowpea, paddy, pineapple, sorghum, vegetables and yams are also grown by farmers as intercrops with areca nut. Other Uses The leaves are used for thatching. In some parts of Sri Lanka the chief vessels used for carrying water are made from the leaves of this graceful palm, which, being of leather-like consistency, are easily converted into strong and durable water buckets. The leaf sheath is made into cups, plates, and bags for holding plantains, sweetmeats, and fish. The flower sheath is made into skullcaps, small umbrellas, and dishes. The husk fibres are predominantly composed of cellulose with varying proportions of hemi-cellulose, lignin, pectin and protopectin. Based on various tests, it has been proposed that the husk fibre could be used in making such items as thick boards, fluffy cushions and non-woven fabrics. Trial experiments have shown that satisfactory yield and quality of brown wrapping paper could be prepared from blends of areca nut and bamboo or banana pseudostem pulp. Areca nut husk can be a good source of furfural. Possibilities of producing activated carbon from the husks have been investigated, and yields of 25-28% have been recorded. The plant is a good source of tannins. These are used for dyeing clothes, as adhesives in plywood manufacture etc. The nut contains 8-12% fat that has characteristics comparable with hydrogenated coconut oil. It contains both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The outside portion of betel palm stem forms a useful building material in the villages, and it is widely used throughout southeast Asia for a variety of construction purposes. The timber can also be used in making a variety of utility articles such as rulers, shelves and waste paper baskets. Nails made from areca stem are widely used in the furniture industry."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: High (4/5). Agroforestry Uses: The plant has an extensive root system, up to 3 metres deep and 10 metres wide. It has been planted, especially on slopes, for soil stabilization. Other Uses The leaf sheath is a source of a tough, black fibre (gomuti or yonot fibre). It is not pliable enough to be used for purposes such as running rigging, but is very strong and durable and used chiefly for making cables and a very strong rope that is tolerant of both fresh and salt water and of fire; it is used for marine work, thatching, upholstery and brushes. The hairs found on the base of the leaf sheaths are very good tinder for igniting fire. The fibre, placed in the bottom of a vessel, is useful for filtering water of its physical impurities. At the base of the leaves there is a woolly material used in caulking ships and stuffing cushions. Old woody leaf bases, as well as the long leaves, can be used for fuel. The split petioles are used for basketry and a form of marquetry. The youngest leaves are sometimes used as cigarette paper. The leaves are used as a source of thatching material. The roots are a useful insect repellent. The trunks of dead trees are allowed to rot and become hollow and are then used as water pipes. The pith of the leaf rachis is an ideal shape for use as a drinking cup. The very hard outer part of the trunk is used for barrels, flooring and furniture. Posts for pepper vines, boards, tool handles and musical instruments like drums are all made from the wood"@en .

It is said to be the strongest fibre that can be produced in Amazonia and is widely used for making hammocks, ropes, bags, clothes etc. The fibre is resistant to rot and damage and was therefore in use on sail- ships in the earlier centuries. The shell of the kernel is used for making handicrafts such as rings, bracelets and collars. The wood is moderately heavy, very hard, strong and durable. It is used locally in making houses. The stems are used as poles for fences, corrals, and rural housing. Its resistance to diseases and high productivity make this species an alternative for the production of biodiesel, since the operating costs of an orderly plantation is much less than that of the oil palm."@en .

This palm is widely used locally for its high quality, stiff fibres which are used in making ropes, mats, and brushes. The fibre is strong, and hard and it does not absorb moisture easily. A fibre obtained from the dilated base of the leaf stalks, which separates into a long, coarse fringe, is collected by cutting with a small axe. The fibre is stiff, wiry, and a bright chocolate in colour. It is employed in the manufacture of brushes, these are largely used on street-sweeping machines, particularly in London. The fibres can be twisted into coarse cables, which are light, durable and float on the water. Fibre from young, undeveloped plants, known as 'bananeiras' is bright coloured and more flexible. Fibre from fully matured plants is separated into three qualities:- (1) Ordinary fibre, which is found wound up among the broken leaves and the upper part of the trunk. (2) Balloon, formed by the older fibre which has fallen to the ground around the base of the trunk. (3) Piassava d'olho, or 'eye piassava', which is the latest growth, and is in all respects similar to that yielded by the 'bananeiras'. The latter, on account of its flexibility and colour, is chiefly used in tying the bales. Its yield is small. The leaves are used for thatching. The seeds can be used to carve buttons and beads for rosaries etc. The fruits have been used to make a good quality charcoal."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: Very High (5/5). Agroforestry Uses: Although somewhat slow growing, the plant can regenerate very vigorously in open areas, to the extent that it is considered to be a weed of pastures. This makes it an excellent species for restoring native woodland and, with its wide range of uses, it is also a very good species to use when establishing a woodland garden. Other Uses The leaves are commonly used for thatch and basketry. Young plants produce very large leaves before the stem is formed, and it is in this state that they are generally used for thatching. The unopened leaves from the centre are preferred since, though they require some preparation, they produce a more uniform thatch. The leaf is shaken until it falls partially open, and then each leaflet is torn at the base so as to remain hanging by its midrib only, which is, however, quite sufficient to secure it firmly. They thus hang all at right angles to the midrib of the leaf, which allows them to be laid in a very regular manner on the rafters. The leaf petioles are used for laths for windows and adobe walls. Decayed stems and leaves are used for mulch. The oil from the seed is excellent for soap production because of its high (45%) lauric acid content. It is also used for making candles. The epicarp (ca. 15% of the fruit) is a primary fuel source. The mesocarp (ca. 20% of the fruit) is a potential source of industrial starch, glucose or alcohol. The endocarp (ca. 59% of the fruit) is an important source of high grade charcoal for the steel industry as well as source of distillation by-products such as tar, acetic acid, methane, etc. It also has a potential use as a substrate for hydroponics. Nut waste is also used locally as a fuel for cooking and to repel insects. The wood is moderately heavy, soft and of low durability if exposed to the elements. It is used for construction purposes in rustic buildings."@en .

The flavour is variable, ranging from bland to strong. Inedible raw, it is boiled in salt water for 30 - 60 minutes, when it becomes floury-textured, oily and pleasant tasting with good nutritious qualities. The fruit is always cooked, because of the presence of an alkaloid, pupunhadine. The fruit is highly nutritious, being very rich in carbohydrate and protein. The fruits are also ground into a flour for baking bread, cakes etc. The ovoid fruit is about 6cm long. The fruit palm is an energy-rich source of carbohydrates and oil; the pulp contains all the essential amino acids and is an excellent source of quality protein. The mesocarp is rich in beta-carotene. It is regarded as probably the most nutritionally balanced of tropical fruits; has twice the protein content of the banana and can produce more carbohydrate per ha than maize. An edible oil is obtained from the seed. It is called oil of macanilla. The mesocarp oil has a relatively high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, notably oleic acid, and contains no cholesterol. It is used for cooking. Seed - eaten raw or made into a meal to flavour drinks. Consumed as nuts. A salt substitute is made by cooking the spadix. The cooked male flowers are used as a condiment. The apical bud is cooked and eaten as a vegetable. A delicacy, in some areas it is eaten as a salad. Fresh, dried and canned palmito is being marketed for use in salads, soups and fillings and as roasted chips. Eating the bud effectively kills the trunk since it is unable to produce side shoots.

Oil levels of up to 62% of the dry weight have been reported, and there are reports that a large pot of boiling fruit can produce 2-3 kg of oil. The oil separates easily when the fruits are cooked. As with other palms, it is a potential source of lauric oils. The seed is rich in saturated fatty acids, and could be used to manufacture cosmetics and soap. The leaves yield thatch for houses and basket materials. The spines of the plant are used in tattooing. (Probably as needles.) The leaves provide a green dye for colouring fabrics. The roots provide a vermicide. The whole plant, including the leaf and stem parts, produces a valuable fibre for manufacturing paper. Cellulose may be produced for cellophane paper and rayon. Wood - exceptionally hard and strong, it has many uses. Used in construction. It is a durable material for bows, arrows, fishing poles, harpoons and carvings. The Amerindians use the wood for flooring and panelling their houses and also fashion long spines into needles.

An edible oil can be extracted from the seed. It is widely used in cooking, making margarines, shortening, filled milk, ice cream, confectioneries etc. The oil is traditionally extracted by grating the kernel, macerating with water and boiling it - the oil floats to the surface and is skimmed off.

  :plant_other_use_text "Landscape uses: Seashore, Specimen, Street tree. Agroforestry Uses: The fibre around the seeds is widely used in making peat-free composts where it replaces the peat. The burnt husks form a useful sort of potash that is used to fertilize the trees. The husks also make valuable mulch for moisture conservation in the dry season and help to suppress weeds. Other Uses An oil obtained from the seed contains fatty alcohol and glycerine. It is widely used in making goods such as soaps, detergents, cosmetics, candles, pharmaceuticals etc and to a lesser extent as a lubricant. The oil can be used as a substitute for diesel oils, for electric generating plants and motor vehicles. This use, however, depends on the price of other fuels being high if it is to be economic. The leaves are interwoven and used as a roofing or thatching material for walls of huts. They can also be woven into mats, baskets etc. The midribs of the leaflets are used for brooms. The root may be used as a toothbrush. The fibrous material that surrounds the seed is known as coir. There are three types of fibre obtained from the husks:- Mat fibre or yarn fibre. This is used in making mats. Bristle fibre. This is used for brush making. Mattress fibre. Used in stuffing mattresses and in upholstery. The fibre can also be used for making ropes and cordage. The hard, woody shell surrounding the seed can be used as cups, bowls, in craft work, buttons, combs, bangles, musical instruments, etc. Coconut-shell flour, obtained from grinding clean, mature coconut shells to fine powder, is used as a filler in the thermoplastic industry and as an abrasive for cleaning machinery. A good quality charcoal is made from the shell of the seed. It gives off an intense heat when burnt. The charcoal is very absorptive and has been used in gas masks. Coconut-shell charcoal may be processed further into activated carbon that has many industrial applications, including general water purification, crystalline sugar preparation and gold purification. The high moisture content of the wood and the difficulty of splitting it has made it relatively unpopular as fuel. The trunk of palm trees has its hardest and most wood-like portion towards the outside of the stem, the inner portion being very fibrous. The outer portion of the coconut stem is a widely used source of timber in the tropics. The stem is red-brown with a coarse texture and straight to entangled grain. The outer portion is hard, heavy, but not very durable. It seasons slowly, with a slight risk of checking, but a high risk of distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. It has a high blunting effect, stellite-tipped and tungsten-carbide tools are recommended; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring; gluing is correct. The wood has traditionally been used in tropical countries for the structural framework of house. Coconut timber taken from the lower and middle parts of the trunk can be used for load-bearing structures in buildings, such as frames, floors and trusses. Coconut trunks can be used for poles, as they have great strength and flexibility. The wood can also be used for high quality furniture and parquet flooring."@en .

Palm oil is obtained from the fruit whilst palm kernel oil is obtained from the seed. They are obtained in a volume ratio of approximately 9 : 1. Palm oil has a wide range of uses, including making margarine, vegetable ghee, bakery fats, ice cream and as a cooking oil. Palm oil is popular in West Africa and Malaysia for cooking and is now imported by India to meet local shortages in edible oil, being cheaper than many other vegetable oils. In West Africa, the unrefine red palm oil is an essential part of the diet and is often added directly to bring richness to soups and sauces. Addition of oil to cereal preparations greatly increases their calorific density, which is particularly advantageous for young children. Palm oil is also used as frying oil in the preparation of snacks such as bean cakes and fried plantain. Its 10% linoleic acid content makes it an excellent source of carotene. This is important in reducing incidence of vitamin A deficiency and the occurrence of nutritional blindness. Palm kernel oil is similar in composition and properties to coconut oil. It also has a wide range of uses, including making margarine, ice cream, confectioneries and as a cooking oil, where it is sometimes combined with coconut oil. The boiled and pounded nuts yield palm nut butter, a thick red liquid popular in Ghana and Liberia for making palm butter soup and other dishes. The plant also provides heart-of-palm, where the soft portion of the apical bud is eaten as a vegetable. Since the tree is single-stemmed, and palm trees are generally unable to produce side branches, harvesting this bud leads to the death of the tree. Palm wine is commonly produced in West Africa by tapping the unopened male inflorescences, or the stem just below the apex of felled oil palms, and fermenting the sap."@en ;

Palm oil is employed in the steel industry (for sheet-steel manufacturing and tin plating, where it protects the iron before the tin is applied) and epoxidized palm oil is a plasticizer and stabilizer in PVC plastics. Palm kernel oil, obtained from the seed, is a non-drying oil. It is used as an alternative to coconut oil in making high quality soaps, as a lubricant etc. It is a source of short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids. These acids are chemical intermediates in the production of fatty alcohols, esters, amines, amides and more sophisticated chemicals, which are components of many products such as surface-active agents, plastics, lubricants and cosmetics. Both oils also have a wide range of other uses, including making detergents, shampoos, cosmetics, lubricating oil additives and fluxes. It is technically possible to produce from palm oil either carbohydrates for conversion to alcohol or a methanolizable oil as a diesel substitute. In Togo, the pressed fruits are dried and fashioned into cakes for cooking fuel. The empty bunches, fibre and also the effluent (0.5 t sludge for each t of milled fruit bunches) from the oil mills can be converted into products such as organic fertilizers. Palm fronds are useful for thatch. The entire palm fronds of this species are less suitable for thatching than those of the coconut palm, because of irregular leaflet insertion. However, the leaflets are often woven into baskets and mats; the leaflet midribs are made into brooms and the rachises used for fencing. Young leaflets produce a fine strong fibre, used for making fishing lines, snares and strainers. The seed shells are polished and carved into ornamental rings and beads. Palm trunks, available at replanting, provide excellent material for paper and board production, but this has not yet attracted much commercial interest. The seed shells are much appreciated by local blacksmiths as a high calorific fuel for furnaces."@en .

The fibres resist rotting, even after long periods of immersion in water; the Brazilians used them to make cables to navigate the Amazon. They are also used for making rope, brooms, brushes and baskets. The foliar sheaths terminate in long (0.5 - 1.5 metres), pendulous fibres. The fibres at first appear as light brown ribbon-like strips, 2 - I0cm wide, that later split into dark brown to greyish brown individual fibres. These fibres persist and hang, entirely concealing the stem, and giving the tree a most curious and unique appearance. The leaves are used for thatch. The leaves resist rotting, even after long periods of being wet, and make a very resistant thatch. They are, therefore, the most sought after of the local palms. The nuts, which are a source of vegetable ivory, are encased in a hard, botryoidal shell which itself takes a nice polish. These shells are mostly 3 - 4cm in diameter and are 5 - 8cm long. The nuts are smaller and are loose in the shells. They have a fine delicate dark veining and are quite beautiful when turned or polished."@en .

Other Uses The large, very hard, ivory-like seeds are used to make a range of carved items and also to make buttons. The leaves and their petioles have a wide range of applications. In particular, they are one of the major sources of thatch, roofs made from these leaves are said to last for 5 years. In addition, the leaflets can be woven into temporary baskets or used to line cooking pits. Gourd bottle-corks/stoppers are made from lightly rolled discs of sago leaves. Whole leaves are used to cover and protect dry-stored canoes. The leaf sheaths are commonly covered externally with rough spines and/or rib-like protuberances. These rough sheaths have served as rasps in the preparation of sago and other food products that must be grated. The stiff, hard midribs may be used to make brooms, may serve as temporary sewing needles or pins, or may be used as thatch sheet skewers. The smooth inner surface of the sheaths can be used as temporary containers, and as kneading boards for bread made from sago. Children sometimes make surfboards from the petiole base (leaf sheath) that can be up to one metre wide. Bats, balls, and rafts are made by children from the leaf base. The wood (outer cortex) of the stems is used as flooring and as planking for crossing short streams or swampy areas. The wood is not reported as being long lasting or durable, but is employed as a by-product by those who extract starch. Wood has also been used as house rafters and as wall material, although this is an infrequent usage. The bark can be used as a fuel."@en .

  :plant_edible_text "The pith of the stem is rich in starch. This has been widely used to make sago. The stem is cut down shortly before the tree flowers, since the carbohydrate content is then at its highest. It is chopped into sections and the fibrous inside is washed to extract the starch. Hot water is poured over the slightly sour wet starch and stirred. The resulting glue-like mass is eaten with fish and vegetable dishes. Usually, the wet starch extracted from the stems is boiled, fried or roasted, alone or mixed with other foodstuffs. It is also used industrially in the manufacture of cakes, noodles, kerupuk and custard powders. The fully ripe fruit is astringent, but is eaten as a delicacy by local people. Apical bud - raw or cooked. It is commonly steamed and eaten as a side dish with rice or added to stews. Harvesting this bud effectively eventually kills the individual trunk because it is unable to make side branches."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Sago palm has been planted in buffer zones as a method of rehabilitating degraded lands, for instance the coastal plains of Indonesia where thousands of hectares of land had been abandoned. Especially when in wetter soils, the roots help to stabilize the soil by trapping silt. Young palms, with their numerous spines, act as effective barriers for livestock and potential trespassers. As the palms mature and develop above-ground stems, new palms may be planted adjacent to the juveniles to maintain the spininess of the fence. Other Uses The leaves, and the fibres obtained from them, are commonly used for thatching, weaving mats etc. It is said that thatch made from this plant will last for at least 5 years. Processing of the pith to yield starch produces a fibre. The waste from pith processing is used as a fertilizer. Dextrose sugar extract from sago palm starch can be processed to yield alcohol for use as a biofuel. The starch obtained from the stems is also used for various other products including to make a sizing paste for paper and textiles. The cortex of the trunk is also used for firing in paper mills. The bark may be used as a domestic fuel after drying. The frond rachis is often used for fastening between horizontal posts in walls. The bark may be used as a flooring material. The hard outside of the trunk is used for building purposes."@en .

It is used to make mats, hats, baskets, bags, ropes, hammocks, ceremonial costumes, etc. It may be woven into cloth. In Europe it is used as tying material for horticulture and handicrafts. Raffia fibre has been considered as a potential source of pulp for paper production. The tough fibre (known as piassava) obtained from the petioles and leaf sheaths, is used for making brooms. It is used for the roller brushes employed in sweeping streets; for making mats, bags, hammocks, ropes, etc. A tough, weather-resistant, coarse rope can also be made from this fibre. Piassava fibre is also used to make exceptionally strong paper. A very fine-textured charcoal, much favoured for the manufacture of home-made gunpowder, can be made from the fibre. Piassava fibre is water resistant, hard-wearing, and has the right balance between stiffness and elasticity to give a firm stroke to a broom and sufficient spring action to make the broom self-cleaning. Mature leaves yield higher quality piassava fibre than younger leaves. The large midribs of the leaves, and the leaf stalks, are widely used by native people to construct the framework of houses, as poles for various uses and for making into furniture, ladders etc. They can be split into strips for maing screens, weaving into mats, baskets etc. The leaves, split lengthwise, are used for thatching, though they last only 1 year. They are also used to make mats, baskets and other articles of wickerwork, and are used for hut-walls and fences. Wood - used for construction. The stem can be used in house-building, both for the framework and roof-poles and also for furniture frames; the outer splints are used for heavy mat screens, hut partitions and ceilings.

The fruit is edible, but somewhat bitter. The terminal bud of the palm is eaten as palm cabbage. An intoxicating beverage called Bourdon is obtained by tapping the trunk and fermenting the sap obtained. The sweet sap is extracted by removing the immature inflorescence and collecting the sap that runs out of the portion of cut stem remaining on the tree. In contrast to Raphia hookeri, the sap is not much used for wine making. The sap is also concentrated to make a sweet syrup. When the stems are harvested to be used as poles, they are allowed to lie on the ground for several days whilst the sap was drained. The drink obtained by this method is less sweet and more alcoholic that the drink obtained from the genuine wine palm (Elaeis spp)."@en ;

The leaves are considered as one of the best local thatching materials, being more durable than other materials. Bound with lines, they are used as a thatching material. The vascular bundle fibres, obtained from the leaf sheaths, are made into brooms and brushes. The fibres are about 90 - 120cm long. The bast fibres serve the weaving of mats, baskets, belts, hammocks, fishing lines, and as tying material, used in the horticulture. The oil, extracted from the mesocarp of the fruits by cooking, is used as food (raphia butter) or utilized as fuel oil, lubricant, or pomade. The leaf stems are about 2 metres long. They are used as a building material in a similar manner to bamboo for making the framework of native dwellings. The mid-ribs are stout but light. They have a wide range of uses including as poles, paddles, material for house building, furniture making etc. When split, they provide material for weaving floor mats. The main stems of the plant are used as house posts. Industrial Crop: Fibre."@en .

It is taken internally in the treatment of impotence, debility in elderly men, prostate enlargement and inflammation, bronchial complaints associated with coldness, and wasting diseases. Saw palmetto is one of the few Western herbs that are considered to be anabolic (strengthening and building body tissue and encouraging weight gain). The fruit pulp, or a tincture, is given to those suffering from wasting disease, general debility and failure to thrive. The fruit also has a beneficial effect on the urinary system, helping to reduce the size of an enlarged prostate gland and strengthening the neck of the bladder. The fruit has a probable oestrogenic action, it is prescribed in the treatment of impotence, reduced or absent sex drive and testicular atrophy in men and to stimulate breast enlargement in women. The fruit is also used in the treatment of colds, coughs, irritated mucous membranes, asthma etc. A suppository of the powdered fruits, in cocoa butter, has been used as a uterine and vaginal tonic.
