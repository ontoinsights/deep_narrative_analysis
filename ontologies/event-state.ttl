:has_active_agent a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_agent ;
  rdfs:label "has active agent" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Agent ;
  :definition "References an Agent who is an active/animate participant (carries out some action) in an EventAndState." .

:has_agent a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:label "has agent" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Agent ;
  :definition "References an Agent who participates in or who experiences an EventAndState. Whether the Agent is active in the event/state/condition or experiences/is affected by it can be distinguished by the sub-properties, :has_active_agent, :has_affected_agent or :has_holder." .

:has_affected_agent a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_agent ;
  rdfs:label "has affected agent" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Agent ;
  :definition "References an Agent who is affected by an EventAndState but does not actively participate in it." ;
  :example "For example, if a mob attacked a Person, then that event would be defined as an instance of an Attack (a subclass of EventAndState) where the mob (a GroupOfAgents) is referenced using the :has_active_agent property and the attacked Person is identified using the :has_affected_agent property." .

:has_destination a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_location ;
  rdfs:label "has destination location" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Location ;
  :definition "References the final location when an EventAndState involves movement of persons, goods, information, etc." .

:has_holder a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_agent ;
  rdfs:label "has holder" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Agent ;
  :definition "References an Agent who experiences some EventAndState." ;
  :example "For example, the general situation regarding the number of employed/unemployed individuals in a GeopoliticalEntity (such as a Country) would associate the Country to an Employment/Unemployment individual (subclasses of Environment) using the property, :has_holder." .

:has_instrument a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:label "has instrument" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Resource ;
  :definition "References an inanimate entity (weapon, tool, etc.) that is/was used in an EventAndState." .

:has_origin a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_location ;
  rdfs:label "has origin location" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Location ;
  :definition "References the original location when an EventAndState involves movement of persons, goods, information, etc." .

:has_provider a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_agent ;
  rdfs:label "has providing agent" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Agent ;
  :definition "References the Agent that provides goods, information, ... when an EventAndState involves movement of persons, cargos, etc." .

:has_recipient a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_agent ;
  rdfs:label "has receiving agent" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Agent ;
  :definition "References the Actor that receives goods, information, ... when an EventAndState involves movement of persons, cargos, etc." .

:has_resource a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:label "has resource" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Resource ;
  :definition "References a Resource which is affected by/described by an EventAndState. This property is similar to the predicates, :has_affected_agent and :has_holder. Note that the semantics of this relationship is different than :has_instrument. The latter refers to a Resource that is used in an EventAndState, whereas here, the semantics refer to the subject." ;
  :example "For example, if a storage facility can hold x cubic feet of materials, then that Resource (a BuildingAndDwelling individual) would be identified as the 'subject' of an instance of a Capacity instance (a subclass of Environment). Or, if a building is defaced, then the BuildingAndDwelling would be identified in an AttackDamageAndAssault instance using the :has_resource predicate." .

:has_topic a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:label "has topic" ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  :definition "References the subject/topic of an EventAndState." ;
  :example "For example, if there is an investigation of a crime, then the crime would be some subclass of EventAndState (such as an AttackDamageAndAssault instance), and the Investigation event would reference that earlier attack/assualt using the :has_topic property. As another example, if a farmer has a large fruit crop that situation would be described using an instance of an :AgricultureApicultureAndAquacultureEvent with the :has_agent property referencing the farmer (or his/her farm as a business/Organization) and the fruit (a sub-class of Resource -> FoodAndDrink) defined using the :has_topic property." .

:scheduled_time a owl:ObjectProperty ;
  rdfs:label "scheduled time" ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :has_time ;
  rdfs:domain :EventAndState ;
  rdfs:range :Time ;
  :definition "References a Time at which some event will/should occur or some condition should be in effect." ;
  :noun_synonym "zero hour" .
