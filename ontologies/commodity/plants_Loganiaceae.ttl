  :plant_physical_characteristics "Spigelia Marilandica is a PERENNIAL growing to 0.5 m (1ft 8in) by 0.3 m (1ft).  It is hardy to zone (UK) 8.  It is in flower in July. The species is hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs).  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or  moist soil."@en ;
  :plant_edible_text "None known"@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_use :Anthelmintic, :Analgesic, :SedativeAndHypnotic ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The whole plant, but especially the root, is anthelmintic and narcotic. A safe and effective anthelmintic when used in the proper dosage, it is especially effective with tapeworms and roundworm. Its use should always be followed by a saline aperient such as magnesium sulphate otherwise unpleasant side effects will follow. Another report says that it can be used with other herbs such as Foeniculum vulgare or Cassia senna. These will ensure that the root is expelled along with the worms since the root is potentially toxic if it is absorbed through the gut. The root is best used when fresh but can be harvested in the autumn then dried and stored. It should not be stored for longer than 2 years. Use with caution and only under professional supervision. The plant contains the alkaloid spigiline,which is largely responsible for the medicinal action but side effects of an overdose can include increased heart action, vertigo, convulsions and possibly death."@en ;

  :plant_physical_characteristics "Strychnos Potatorum is a deciduous Tree growing to 12 m (39ft) by 12 m (39ft) at a slow rate. It is hardy to zone (UK) 10.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) or  semi-shade (light woodland). It prefers dry or  moist soil and can tolerate drought."@en ;
  :plant_edible_part :PlantFruit ;
  :plant_edible_text "Young fruits - occasionally eaten or made into preserves. The pulp is eaten. They are an ingredient of 'Raja's Cup', an Ayurvedic coffee substitute. The fruit is a sub-globose berry 12 - 18mm in diameter with a firm pericarp, black when ripe, containing 1 - 2 seeds in a whitish pulp."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The pounded leaves are used to treat watering and aching eyes. A decoction is taken to treat epilepsy The roots are aphrodisiac. The vapour of a root decoction is inhaled to treat colds and venereal diseases. A decoction of the roots and leaves is taken to treat cough. The seeds are used for the treatment of a range of complaints including those affecting the liver, kidneys and stomach; gonorrhoea, leucorrhoea, bronchitis, chronic diarrhoea, strangury, kidney and bladder stones, diabetes and eye diseases. The plant contains many monomeric and dimeric indole alkaloids, the root bark being especially rich. The monoterpene alkaloid cantleyine, isolated from the root bark, has shown a relaxing effect on isolated tracheal smooth muscles and may be the active ingredient responsible for the anti-cough and anti-asthmatic activity. Normacusine B, a monomeric alkaloid of the corynanthe class, also found in Rauvolfia, Tabernaemontana and Vinca spp., is sympatholytic and its hypotensive activity is stronger than that of reserpine, which is commonly used against high blood pressure. The total alkaloid extracts of the seeds, bark and leaves showed strychnine-like activity in vivo, had marked hypotensive effect and exhibited a depressant action on isolated heart muscle. In-vivo tests using the seed powder and an aqueous extract of the seeds prevented ulcer formation by decreasing acid secretory activity and increasing the mucin activity. An aqueous extract of the seeds has shown significant hepatoprotective activity. A methanol extract of the seeds had a diuretic effect and an antidiarrhoeal activity on castor oil-induced diarrhoea."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses: The cut seeds are rubbed around the insides of a rough earthenware vessel and water is then placed in the vessel. This causes most of the impurities in the water to sink to the bottom after a while so that the clean(er!) water can be poured off. The seeds contain polyelectrolytes which can be used as coagulants to clarify turbid waters. In laboratory tests, direct filtration of turbid surface water with the seeds as a coagulant, produced a substantial improvement in its aesthetic and microbiological quality. The yellowish-grey wood has conspicuous white markings. It is close-grained, very hard and termite resistant, but splits easily and is therefore not suitable for carving. It is used to make carts, shafts, agricultural implements, tool handles etc."@en .
