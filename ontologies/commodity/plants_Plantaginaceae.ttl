  :plant_medicinal_text "Brahmi is a very important Ayurvedic herb, being particularly valued for its beneficial effect upon the nervous system. Its main active substances are steroidal saponins, including bacosides. The whole plant is used - roots, stems and leaves. It is cardiac, nervine tonic, sedative and vasoconstrictor. The leaves and stalks are aperient and diuretic. An alcohol extract of the whole plant has been shown to have anticancer activity against Walker carcinoma. An alcohol extract of plant is a muscle relaxant and cardiovascular relaxant. Research in India suggests that brahmi improves mental function, memory and concentration, and also reduces learning time. The plant contains the alkaloid brahmine, which has been shown to raise blood pressure when administered in therapeutic dosage, but to be hypotensive when given in very strong dosage. A tranquilizing saponin that resembles reserpine is also present. The plant is used principally in the treatment of a range of nervous system disorders including neuralgia, hysteria, epilepsy, insanity, neurasthenia, aphonia and hoarseness. The plant is also taken internally in a number of other conditions including indigestion, ulcers, wind, constipation, asthma, bronchitis and infertility. A poultice made of the boiled plant is applied to the chests of children in the treatment of acute bronchitis and other coughs. A juice made from the plant is applied as a wash on burns."@en ;

The plant is seen as an antibilious, antibiotic, antidote, aphrodisiac, bitter, blood purifier, emetic, febrifuge, hepatic, hypoglycaemic and stomachic. The roots, leaves and tops are traditionally used in India, Indo-China and South-East Asia as an analgesic, diuretic and antipyretic, to treat gastric disorders such as diarrhoea and dysentery, and also for cough, bronchitis, hypertension, haemorrhoids and insect bites. Research has shown that the plant contains a number of medically active compounds - the aerial parts contain about 4% of a viscous oil which, besides fatty acids like stearic, myristic and linolenic acid, also contains a series of diterpenes. The aerial parts also yield nitrogen-containing components and flavonoids. Scopadulin, a diterpene from the aerial parts, has shown mild antiviral activity. The antiviral activity of scopadulciol, a tetracyclic diterpenoid, was found to inhibit the virus replication, as shown by reduction of virus production. Scopadulcic acid B has been shown to have a tumour-inhibiting action and has also been shown to inhibit replication of herpes simplex virus type 1. The fresh stems and leaves contain a compound called amellin, thought by some to have an important therapeutic action in diabetes; however, others doubt this. Oral administration of amellin relieves symptoms of glycosuria, reduces hyperglycaemia and increases RBC count. It has also been found helpful in anaemia, albuminuria, ketonuria, retinitis and other complications associated with diabetes mellitus. Unlike insulin, amellin does not cause blood sugar levels to drop below normal and reduction of both blood and urine sugar occurs gradually. In a clinical trial, 25 healthy people and 30 with gingivitis were given mouthwashes containing 1% aqueous extract of the plant or 0.02% chlorhexidine gluconate for 6 weeks. There was a slight increase in gingival inflammation in people with gingivitis using the extract, but the antiplaque activity was similar to that of 0.02% chlorhexidine. The whole plant is used for treating a wide range of disorders including diabetes, herpes, coughs and colds, fevers, nausea, dizziness, and as an antidote for snakebites and cassava intoxication. In low doses, often in milk, it is used to relieve vomiting in infants, whilst in larger does it is used to induce vomiting to clear out the digestive system. A decoction of the plant is drunk as a treatment for remittent fever and gonorrhoea, and also to induce labour. A cold decoction of the plant is taken as a remedy for gravel and kidney complaints. The fresh or dried plants are used externally to treat a wide range of skin problems, including pimples, impetigo, ulcers, eczema, bruises and contusions. An infusion of the herb is used as a mouthwash for infected gums. The leaves are chewed to treat cough; they first taste bitter and later sweet (like liquorice). They were formerly used in the treatment of diabetes. The leaves are macerated in warm water and drunk copiously when cooled in the treatment of feverish headaches."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The plant is sometimes used as a sand binder. Other Uses: The bushy stems are much used to make temporary brooms for sweeping floors, and there is a belief that they destroy fleas. The fresh or dried plants are said to kill fleas, lice and intestinal worms."@en .
