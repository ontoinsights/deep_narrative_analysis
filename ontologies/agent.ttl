  rdfs:label "Affiliation" ;
  :definition "An Affiliation defines the (typically) long-term association of an Agent (the :affiliated_agent) or Location, to another entity such as a Organization or GeopoliticalEntity.

Another possibility to defining an Agent's role is to use the :role datatype property. This permits the capture of the role in the specific text/vocabulary of the narrative, whereas the :has_role property maps that text to an enumerated value." ;

The contemporary common political conception of progressivism emerged from the vast social changes brought about by industrialization in the Western world in the late-19th century. Progressives take the view that progress is being stifled by vast economic inequality between the rich and the poor; minimally regulated laissez-faire capitalism with monopolistic corporations; and the intense and often violent conflict between those perceived to be privileged and unprivileged, arguing that measures were needed to address these problems. The meanings of progressivism have varied over time and from different perspectives. Early-20th century progressivism was tied to eugenics and the temperance movement, both of which were promoted in the name of public health and as initiatives toward that goal. Contemporary progressives promote public policies that they believe will lead to positive social change. In the 21st century, a movement that identifies as progressive is 'a social or political movement that aims to represent the interests of ordinary people through political change and the support of government actions'.'" ;
