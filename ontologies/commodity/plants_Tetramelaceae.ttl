  :plant_edible_text "Young leaves - cooked and eaten as a vegetable."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "A leaf extract is used to cure stomach-ache."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The trees extensive root system binds the soil, making it an ideal plant for stabilizing river banks. The tree is actually a pioneer species in the rainforest, rapidly invading new banks of alluvial soil built up by the rivers, but unable to regenerate once other trees close the canopy below them. Other Uses A dye is obtained from the bark. The heartwood is absent. The wood is light, relatively soft, coarse-textured, brittle and with poor resistance to decomposition. It is only suitable for use under cover where a weak, perishable timber will suffice, being employed to make match boxes, concrete moulds, pallets etc, and for pulp. The colossal stems are, however, suitable for making large canoes."@en .
