  :plant_medicinal_text "The tree provides traditional medicines throughout its range. Various preparations of the bark, and to a lesser extent other parts of the tree, are used. Research has been carried out into the medicinal properties of the plant with promising results. The oil from the seed contains about 20% kombic acid and sargaquinoic acid, plus several of their derivatives. These terpenoid quinonic acids have promising anti-oxidant properties for pharmacology. They have also shown hypoglycaemic activity in diabetes patients.. The bark contains dihydroguaiaretic acid, which has shown non-selective toxicity towards several human tumour cell lines. Extracts of the bark have shown the presence of flavonoids, tannins and saponin glycosides, which might be responsible for its biological activities. Terpenoid quinones that have shown hypoglycaemic activity in both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent diabetes have been extracted from the bole and leaves. The bark is an emeto-purgative, and a decoction can act as an antidote to poisoning; to cleanse the milk of lactating mothers; and also as a treatment for conditions such as coughs and chest complaints, malaria, anaemia, ascites and leprosy. If pounded, it can be used as a stomachic. The bark is also used to treat a number of gynaecological problems, ranging from infertility to gonorrhoea. The bark can be used to help relieve the pain of toothache. Various preparations of the bark are used to treat skin infections, especially of the mouth. The sap is styptic. A decoction of the leaves is taken internally and also as an enema to treat dropsy. The leaf can be used to help relieve the pain of toothache. The oil obtained from the seed, and probably the leaf juice, is used in treating thrush. An infusion of the root is used as an anthelmintic. A root macerate, mixed with parts of other plants, is taken by draught to treat schistosomiasis."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The tree is often retained when the forest is cleared, and is also planted in order to provide shade for banana, coffee and cocoa plantations. When growing wild, the tree is condisered to be a good indicator of soil fertility. Other Uses The seeds are pounded and used as a soap substitute. The seeds yield 45 - 70% of a yellow to reddish brown oil that is solid at room temperature. Known as 'kombo butter', the taste is bitter and it is not suitable for eating. It is used in making soap and as an illuminant. The melting point of the fat is 51?c, the fatty acid composition is 5.5% lauric acid; 61.5% myristic acid; 3.6% palmitic acid; 23.6% myristoleic acid; 5.7% oleic acid. Crude kombo butter contains about 20% kombic acid and sargaquinoic acid, plus several of their derivatives. These terpenoid quinonic acids have promising anti-oxidant properties for cosmetics and the stabilization of plastics The seeds burn like candles. The heartwood is whitish to pinkish brown, sometimes with yellowish markings; it is not clearly differentiated from the sapwood. The grain is generally straight; the texture medium to coarse; the wood has no lustre; when freshly sawn it has an unpleasant odour which disappears upon drying. The wood is very light to light in weight; very soft to soft; not durable, being liable to attack by termites, powder-post beetles, pinhole borers and marine borers. It is rather difficult to dry, being prone to collapse, end splitting and distortion. The wood is easy to saw and plane with normal tools; blunting effects are moderate; it is difficult to polish; nailing and screwing are easy and holding properties are moderate to good; it splits easily and well. The wood may stain in contact with tools. It peels and slices well to produce good-quality veneer and plywood, although steaming is recommended because of the occasional presence of numerous small hard spots. It glues well with all types of glue; paints well but is rather absorbent. It is used for veneer peeling, panels, furniture frames, box-making, pencils and minor joinery. It is used traditionally to make shingles for the roofs and sides of houses, whilst the long straight bole makes it suitable for making canoes. It is used for firewood. The wood makes a highly prized fuel."@en .

The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). . The plant is not self-fertile.  Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils.

  :plant_medicinal_text "The sap is used for treating ulcers and skin eruptions The bark is astringent, emetic and stimulant.An infusion is used in the treatment of dyspepsia, intestinal colic, erysipelas and inflammations. The bark is boiled with water and used to induce vomiting. The macerated bark is soaked in water and drunk as an anti-diarrhoeal. Juice from the bark is applied externally as an analgesic for cracked heels. An infusion of the bark is used as a wash for cleaning contusions and ulcers. A decoction of the bitter red sap from the bark is gargled or drunk to treat thrush and sores of the mouth. The sap becomes resinous on exposure to air and is then used to relieve the pain of toothache and to cauterize aphthae. An exudate from the bark is worked into preparations with psychotropic properties by the native peoples of S. America."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "The seed yields an oil formerly used as illuminating oil. The oil is used for making candles and soap. The seeds burn readily with a clear light. Native people stick them on a thin piece of hard wood and use them as torches when they have to go out in the dark. Cut or damaged trees exude a blood-red, watery latex that is similar to the kino of commerce. The heartwood is a uniform light reddish, greyish or brown; merging gradually into the pale golden to pale rose-brown sapwood. The wood is straight-grained; medium-textured; with a medium to high lustre; odour and taste indistinct. It is moderately heavy; of low durability; very susceptible to termite and pinhole borer attack. It works easily with ordinary tools and finishes well; nails and screws easily without splitting; it can be stained, varnished and polished with good results; turns satisfactorily; glues readily. It is used for construction, internal finishing in buildings, toys, light boxes etc, and is suitable for making toothpicks."@en .
