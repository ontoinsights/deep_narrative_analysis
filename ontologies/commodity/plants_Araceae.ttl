  :plant_edible_text "Corm - cooked. The root must be thoroughly boiled or baked, it is acrid when raw (see notes above on 'Known Hazards'). Very large, it can be up to 30cm in diameter. In Japan the large brown tubers are peeled, cooked and pounded to extract their starch, which is solidified with dissolved limestone into an edible gel called 'Konnyaku'. Konnyaku is a type of flour valued for its use in many dietary products. The flour is valued for its ability to clean the digestive tract without being a laxative. A nutritional analysis is available. This root is very high in water and low in calories, so it is being promoted as a diet food in N. America. Especially just before the foliage declines prior to dormancy, the tubers are a rich source of mannan, a polysaccharide of mannose and glucose. The mannose is extracted and widely used in foods for diabetics. Glucomannan, a soluble fibre formed from mannan and glucose, cannot be metabolized by the human body, but is metabolized by intestinal bacteria. Inside the digestive system, glucomannan absorbs up to 200 times its weight in water without any negative action upon the digestive system. It therefore can give a feeling of fullness and be of use to aid in weight loss, it also relieves constipation and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as reducing serum cholesterol levels. Glucomannan is widely used as an emulsifier and stabilizer in foods and drinks."@en ;

In this, the plants are grown in a natural plant community and heavily mulching the plants with grain straw or wild herbs. The plants thus grown are remarkably free from pests and diseases. The largest tubers are harvested at the end of the year, leaving the rest in the ground to grow on for harvest in later years. Other Uses The plant has insecticidal properties. Glucomannan, obtained from the tuber, has a wide range of used in various industries. It has gelling and film-forming properties and is widely used as an emulsifier and stabilizer in foods, drinks, cosmetics and the pharmaceutical industry. It is also used as a non-clay drilling fluid in the diamond and oil industries. Ground cover."@en .

A bread can be made from the dried and powdered seeds, it tastes like corncake with a strong flavour of cocoa. Spadix (the flowering stem) and berries - cooked. A great delicacy, but they must be very well cooked otherwise they are poisonous. The Indians would boil them for 9 hours. Root - must be well cooked in order to destroy an acrimonious principle, see the notes above on toxicity. The root is rich in starch and can weigh up to 2.7 kilos. It is highly astringent and has an unpleasant flavour. The root can be dried and ground into a powder for use when making bread, soups etc."@en ;

Modern research has shown that this remedy is very effective in controlling nausea and vomiting. It is also an ingredient of a Chinese prescription for removing gallstones without surgery, a process that usually causes severe nausea. The root is also used internally in the treatment of coughs with thin watery phlegm and gastritis. The fresh root is extremely acrid and contains toxins, these are neutralized upon drying or by soaking in tea or vinegar. The root is harvested in the summer and dried for later use, it should not be used fresh. Extracts of the plant have been shown to have analgesic, antiemetic, anticancer and sedative activity."@en ;

  :plant_medicinal_text "Skunk cabbage was much used by the native North American Indians primarily for its expectorant and antispasmodic properties to treat bronchitis and asthmatic conditions, a use that is still employed in modern herbalism. The plant should be used with some caution, however, and preferably under professional supervision. Handling the fresh leaves can cause skin to blister whilst excessive doses of the root can bring on nausea and vomiting, headaches and dizziness. The root is antispasmodic, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, expectorant and slightly narcotic. The rootstock is harvested in late autumn or early spring and dried for later use. It should not be stored for a long time because it loses its medicinal virtues. The rootstock has been used internally in the treatment of respiratory and nervous disorders, including asthma, whooping cough, catarrh, bronchitis and hay fever. It is occasionally used to treat epilepsy, headaches, vertigo and rheumatic problems. Externally, it has been used as a poultice to draw splinters and thorns, to heal wounds and to treat headaches. The root hairs or rootlets have been applied to dental cavities to treat toothache. A tea made from the root hairs has been used externally to stop bleeding. An inhalation of the crushed leaves has been used in the treatment of headaches. The leaf bases have been applied as a wet dressing to bruises."@en ;

However, calcium oxalate is easily broken down either by thoroughly cooking the plant or by fully drying it and, in either of these states, it is safe to eat the plant.
