A decoction of the leaves, combined with the leaves of avocado (Persea americana) is drunk as an antihypertensive. The leaves may also be used to make a decoction, which is taken orally with salt for digestive tract ailments and to relieve fatigue. The pungent leaves are well-known for their sleep-inducing properties - they can be taken in an infusion, or simply placed under the pillow. Applied externally, the crushed leaves are used to maturate boils and abscesses. A massage of the leaves is good for remedying nervous shock. The fruit is antiscorbutic, febrifuge, mildly antidysenteric and a good vermifuge. It is used to treat bedwetting in children. A decoction is used to remedy excess foot and hand perspiration. The fruit is used to make a tonic that is used for treating fever, headache, hypertension, and heart problems. A crushed leaf and seed decoction is taken orally for intestinal malaise. The leaves and bark are cardiotonic and sedative. A decoction is used for treating anxiety attacks. The green bark is rubbed on wounds to stop bleeding.

Other Uses Two types of essential oil are obtained from the flowers, both of which are used to supply the dominant odour note of many perfumes:- Cv. Group 'Ylang-ylang' produces ylang-ylang oil, which has a more subtle perfume. 'Extra' quality ylang-ylang oil is much used in high-class perfumery. Third grade ylang ylang oil has a harsher, more tenacious odour and, like cananga oil, is mainly used in soaps and toiletries for men. Cv. Group 'Cananga' yields cananga oil which has a harsher, more tenacious odour. It can be mixed with coconut oil and used as a hair oil named Macassar oil. It is also often used in soaps and toiletries for men. The fragrant yellow-green flowers are made into leis. They are also used to scent coconut oil. The fragrant flowers are used for personal adornment and decoration at festivities and other celebrations. Malaysians and Indonesians are very fond of the scent, and the women like to hide a flower in their hair. The fresh flowers are used in various ceremonies in Java and Bali. The flowers are also put away with clothes, or scattered about the bed. The bark can be beaten to make coarse ropes. The heartwood is pinkish-buff, yellowish to light gray; it is not differentiated from the sapwood. The texture is coarse; the grain straight; there is no distinctive odour or taste. The wood is light in weight; not very durable, being vulnerable to termite attack. It is easy to season with little or no degrade. It is said to be easy to work and finishes smoothly. The wood is used locally for general construction, turnery and making canoes, and is also used for making boxes, tea chests and plywood. It has potential for making small drums and matchsticks. The wood is sometimes used for fuel."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses The light yellow wood is made up entirely of sapwood. The texture is very fine; the grain straight; lustre is medium; there is no distinctive odour or taste. The wood is very strong, extremely hard, elastic; durable. It is moderately difficult to work because of its high density, but finishes smoothly and is excellent for turnery. Said to be the equal of boxwood in hardness, it is used for making fishing rods, billiard cues, archery bows, articles of turnery, masts, textile machinery, and small tool handles."@en .
