  :plant_medicinal_text "Spreading hogweed is used in traditional medicine in several parts of its range, but is especially popular in India where it is a part of the Ayurvedic tradition. The whole herb, including the root, is used and it is said to be bitter, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic, expectorant, laxative and stomachic. Research has shown the presence of an alkaloid, beta sitosterol and various other compounds in the roots An alcohol extract of the whole plant has shown significant antiinflammatory activity, a cardiotonic effect, an increase in blood pressure, a relaxant effect and promising diuretic activity. The plant is emetic and purgative. It is used in the treatment of various conditions including gastric disturbances, asthma, jaundice, anascara, anaemia and internal inflammation. It has also been used as an antidote to snake venom. A decoction of the leaves is used to treat jaundice. The leaves are used in a cataplasm for treating indurated liver. The root can be used as an ipecacuanha (Carapichea ipecacuanha) substitute. Antispasmodic, very astringent, diuretic, emetic, emmenagogue, purgative and sudorific herb, it can be used in a decoction to treat dysentery and a range of other conditions.

The root contains about 7% protein, a good quantity for a root crop and up to 87% carbohydrate on a dry weight basis. Roots can be the size of a man's forearm. Some forms, especially those from Bolivia, contain an astringent substance that can burn the lips and mouth. When exposed to the sun these roots become sweet and are pleasant to eat. Forms grown in Ecuador are not astringent. Roots can be used in sweet or savoury dishes. The cooking water makes an especially flavourful drink. Leaves - raw. Added to salads. The leaves contain about 17% protein (this is probably based on the dry weight."@en ;
