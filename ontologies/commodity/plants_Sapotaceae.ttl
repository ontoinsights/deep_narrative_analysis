The fruit is not good unless allowed to remain on the tree until fully ripe; if picked when immature it is astringent and contains a sticky, white latex. The skin needs to be removed since biting into it leaves a horrible stickiness in the mouth. When opening a star apple fruit, one should not allow any of the bitter latex of the skin to contact the edible fresh. The ripe fruit, preferably chilled, is cut in half and the flesh spooned out, leaving the seed cells and core. A better way of serving the fruit is to cut around the middle completely through the rind and then, holding the fruit stem-end down, twisting the top gently back and forth. As this is done, the flesh will be felt to free itself from the downward half of the rind, and the latter will pull away, taking with it the greater part of the core. An emulsion of the slightly bitter seed kernels is used to make imitation milk-of-almonds or nougat and other confections."@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses The tree is tapped for its milky latex, the source of balata gum - a non-elastic rubber which is similar to gutta-percha. In some areas, trees have yielded sap for more than 25 years. The latex is coagulated by fire or dried in the sun, and souvenirs or novelties are then fabricated from it. Gutta-percha is a natural latex obtained from the sap of the tree. Allowing this fluid to evaporate and coagulate in the sun produces a hard and durable latex which can be made flexible again with hot water, but which does not become brittle. Prior to the advent of synthetic materials, gutta-percha had a wide range of uses - most particularly as an insulating material for electricity wiring and for underwater telegraph wires, a purpose for which it is very well suited since it is bio-inert and so is not attacked by marine plants or animals. Gutta-percha can be moulded into any shape and has been used to make items such as ornate furniture, pistol grips, acid-resistant receptacles and ‘mourning’ jewellery, where its dark colour was an advantage. It has been widely used as the core of golf balls and is still used in modern dentistry where its bio-inertness makes it ideal as a temporary filling for teeth and as a filling material inside tooth fillings. The heartwood is light red when cut and turns to dark reddish brown with purplish shades when dry; it is distinct, but not sharply demarcated from the 4 - 6cm wide band of whitish to pale brown sapwood. It is finely and uniformly textured; usually straight-grained, though sometimes interlocked; sometimes with a characteristic odour when fresh, though this disappears upon drying. The wood is very hard, very heavy, tough, strong, elastic; very durable, even in contact with the soil, being very resistant to fungi, dry wood borers and termites, but susceptible to marine borers. It seasons slowly, with a high risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is poorly stable in service. The wood has a fairly high blunting effect, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; it rates excellent for boring, fair for planing, and poor for turning; it finishes very well; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring; gluing is correct for internal purposes only, and needs to be done with care because of the density of the wood. A strong and attractive wood that resembles mahogany, it is highly valued commercially and is widely used in the tropics for railway sleepers, bridging, heavy construction, furniture, turnery, flooring, violin bows, and billiard cues. Its strength, high wear resistance, and durability qualify the timber for use in textile and pulp mill equipment. Its excellent steam-bending properties make it suitable for boat frames and other bent work."@en .

The wood is noted for its strength and durability, it is also very hard, tough, dense, and resistant to insects. It is not easy to work and has a tendency to splinter, but can be finished smoothly. It is suitable for heavy construction, railway ties, furniture, joinery and tool handles."@en .

A decoction of the bark, sometimes mixed with the flowers, is used as a gargle to treat gum inflammation, toothache etc. It is also used to treat gonorrhoea, snakebites, fevers, wounds, scabies and eczema. It is often combined with tamarind bark (Tamarindus indica) then used as a lotion on skin complaints. The leaves are used to treat headache, toothache, wounds and sore eyes, and are smoked to cure infections of the nose and mouth. The flowers have been used as a remedy against diarrhoea. The young fruits have been employed in a gargle for treating sprue. The pounded seeds are used to cure obstinate constipation. Several triterpenes have been isolated from the plant, as well as steroidal glycosides. The major chemical compounds in the flowers are aromatic alcohols and esters. The ethyl-acetate-soluble fraction of an alcoholic extract of the bark showed anti-ulcer activity against experimental gastric ulcers; this activity was attributed to a decrease in gastric acid secretory activity along with strengthening of mucosal defensive mechanisms. A methanolic extract caused hypotensive activity; it may possess calcium-blocking activity."@en ;

Other Uses: The flowers are very aromatic and retain their fragrance for a long time after being dried. They are used as a filling in pillows, strung in garlands or necklaces for decoration, or placed in linen-cupboards. An essential oil used in perfumery can be distilled from them. The leaves contain an essential oil. The bark contains an essential oil. The seeds are used for making necklaces . The saponins from the seeds are effective against the plant pathogens Phytophthora palmivora and Colletotrichum capsici, and field trials in India showed that they can be used for control of these pathogens in betel pepper (Piper betle) plantations. An oil obtained from the seeds is used to make paint and for lighting. The bark has been used for tanning, but the tannin content is low. A brown dye is obtained from the bark. The heartwood is deep red or dark red-brown, often with darker streaks; it is not sharply demarcated from the paler, 5 - 7cm wide band of sapwood. The grain is straight, wavy or slightly interlocked; texture very fine to fine and even, occasionally with watered-silk figure on the tangential face of the sapwood; the taste is bitter and the wood contains saponin and lathers when rubbed with water. The wood is heavy; very hard; very strong and tough; very durable, even when exposed to the weather or in contact with the ground. It is reportedly resistant to marine borer attack and to dry-wood termites. The sapwood is susceptible to Lyctus. It is liable to end-splitting, warping and surface checking if not carefully seasoned. It is generally considered difficult to work, especially in sawing, due to the presence of silica, but is easier to work when still green; stellite-tipped saws are recommended; it finishes very well using sharp tools. The wood is used for heavy general construction, building purposes, boat and shipbuilding, piles, bridges, agricultural implements and oil mills. It is also used for flooring, bearings, doors and framing, poles and piles, foundation sills, railway sleepers, paving blocks, mine timber, furniture and cabinet work, vehicle bodies and wheels, turnery, tool handles, walking sticks, weaving shuttles, toys, sporting goods and musical instruments. A good-quality veneer and plywood can be manufactured from the wood. The tree also yields a good fuelwood. The energy value of the heartwood is 21,340 kJ/kg, that of the sapwood 21,090 kJ/kg."@en .

Allowing this fluid to evaporate and coagulate in the sun produces a hard, durable, non-brittle but non-elastic latex which can be made flexible again when heated to temperatures over 50°c, and then retains any form given while cooling. Prior to the advent of synthetic materials, gutta-percha had a wide range of uses - most particularly as an insulating material for electricity wiring and for underwater telegraph wires, a purpose for which it is very well suited since it is bio-inert and so is not attacked by marine plants or animals. Gutta-percha can be moulded into any shape and has been used to make items such as ornate furniture, pistol grips, acid-resistant receptacles and 'mourning' jewellery, where its dark colour was an advantage. It has been widely used as the core of golf balls and is still used in modern dentistry where its bio-inertness makes it ideal as a temporary filling for teeth and as a filling material inside tooth fillings. It is used locally for fixing tools into their handles. Leaves of about 10 months of age are considered to be the source of the best quality latex. The seeds contain 58 - 63% fat used for the manufacture of soaps and candles. The timber is used for planks that are not exposed to the weather or ground; for panelling; and for the manufacture of fine furniture, decorative doors and veneers. We do not have any more specific information on the wood of this species, but it belongs to a group of timbers collectively called 'Nyatoh'. The general description of nyatoh wood is as follows:- The heartwood is a dark pink to a red-brown; it is clearly demarcated from the 4 - 9cm wide band of sapwood. The texture is medium; the grain straight or interlocked, sometimes wavy. The wood is light in weight, soft to moderately hard; somewhat durable, being resistant to dry wood borers, moderately resistant to fungi but susceptible to termites. It seasons somewhat slowly, with a high risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is stable in service. There is a very variable content of silica according to the species, but in general the wood has a high blunting effect so stellite-tipped and tungsten-carbide tools are recommended; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring; gluing is correct. The wood has a range of applications, including for highclass furniture and cabinet making, panelling, joinery, flooring, light carpentry, turnery, moulding and veneer."@en .

  :plant_edible_text "The kernel of the seed (often incorrectly called 'nut') contains a vegetable fat known as shea butter. Shea butter from fresh seeds is white, odourless and of high quality, while that from stale seeds is dark, and tastes bitter. High quality shea butter is consumed throughout West Africa as a cooking fat. Refined fat has been marketed as margarine and baking fat. It is used for pastries and confectionery because it makes the dough pliable. It is a useful cocoa butter substitute because it has a similar melting point (32 - 45?C) and high amounts of di-stearin (30%) and some stearo-palmitine (6.5%) which make it blend with cocoa butter without altering flow properties. In rural areas, seeds are traditionally processed by hot water extraction, usually the job of women. The fruit pulp is first removed for food, or by fermentation or boiling. The seeds are then boiled and later sun- or kiln-dried. Sun-drying may take 5 - 10 days. Seeds are cracked using mortar and pestle, or stones; the kernels are removed by trampling and redried before being crushed, ground and kneaded to form a paste; the paste is put in water, heated or boiled and the boiling mass is churned until a grey, oily fat separates from the emulsion. The fat is skimmed off from the surface and washed to remove impurities. The congealed fat may subsequently undergo further refining before being moulded in to various forms. This traditional method of processing is inefficient and labour intensive. Mechanization of the various operations, in particular the use of hydraulic or continuous screw expellers or application of solvent extraction, will improve oil extraction efficiency considerably. Pre-treatment of the kernel paste with enzymes (e.g. proteases and cellulases) may also result in higher extraction rates. In spite of their slightly laxative properties, mature fresh fruits are considered an important local food. They are commonly eaten in savannah regions because they ripen during the land preparation and planting season.The pulp has a sweet flavour. The flowers are also considered an important local foods They are sometimes made into fritters. The reddish latex which exudes from deep cuts in the bark is used as a chewing gum."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "Shea butter is a suitable base for topical medicines. Its application relieves rheumatic and joint pains and heals wounds, swellings, dermatitis, bruises and other skin problems. The high proportion of unsaponifiable matter, consisting of 60 - 70% triterpene alcohols, gives shea butter creams good penetrative properties. Allantoin, another unsaponifiable compound, is responsible for the anti-inflammatory and healing effect on the skin. The fat is used traditionally to relieve inflammation of the nostrils. Clinical tests with patients suffering from rhinitis, and having moderate to severe nasal congestion, showed that shea butter may relieve nasal congestion better than conventional nasal drops. The leaves are used to treat stomach-ache. They are also added to vapour baths to treat headache and as an eye bath. Ground roots and bark are used to treat diarrhoea, jaundice and stomach-ache. Bark infusions have medicinal and antimicrobial properties, e.g. against dysentery. They are applied as an eyewash to counteract spitting-cobra venom. A bark decoction has been used in baths to facilitate childbirth and stimulate lactation among feeding mothers"@en ;

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The tree regenerates well, and is traditionally favoured and protected by farmers. As a result, it has played a significant role in soil and water conservation and environmental protection in semi-arid West Africa. The husks of the seeds make a good mulch and fertilizer. Studies on the by-products of shea-butter processing have shown that heavy-metal ions can be removed from aqueous solutions, for example waste water, using Vitellaria seed husks. The tree combines well with many cereal crops. Other Uses Shea butter is a vegetable fat obtained from the seed. Many cosmetic products, especially moisturizers, lotions and lipsticks, use it as a base because its high unsaponifiable matter content imparts excellent moisturizing characteristics. The high proportion of unsaponifiable matter, consisting of 60 - 70% triterpene alcohols, gives shea butter creams good penetrative properties that are particularly useful in cosmetics. Allantoin, another unsaponifiable compound, is responsible for the anti-inflammatory and healing effect on the skin. It is used in toothpastes and other oral hygiene products, in shampoos, lipsticks, cosmetic lotions and creams, and other cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Low-quality shea butter, often mixed with other oils, is a base material for soap. Shea butter is also very suitable for making candles because of its high melting point. As a waterproofing agent, shea butter is used as daubing for earthen walls, doors and windows. The black sticky residue, left after oil extraction, is used to fill cracks in walls and also as a waterproofing material. Waste water from shea butter production has pesticidal properties. The press cake and the husks remaining after oil extraction are potential fertilizers and fuels. The leaves, soaked in water, produce a good lather for washing. The reddish latex (gutta shea or red kano rubber) which exudes from deep cuts in the bark is made into glue, chewing gum and balls for children?s games. Musicians use it to repair drums. Only unproductive and unhealthy trees are cut for timber. The wood is moderately heavy and hard. It is liable to crack on drying and needs to be seasoned slowly. It is difficult to work and tends to split on sawing, but it polishes well. It glues, nails and screws well, but pre-boring is recommended to avoid splitting. It is durable and resistant to termites. Both sapwood and heartwood are resistant to impregnation with preservatives. The wood is used for poles, house posts, rafters, flooring, domestic utensils and furniture. It is an excellent fuel wood, burning with great heat, and a source of charcoal."@en .
