The flowers are pollinated by Wind. Suitable for: medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils and  can grow in very acid soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought."@en ;
  :plant_edible_text "None known"@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The bark is astringent. The leaves are used to treat catarrh and headache, and are sometimes used in the treatment of cancer. The vapour from a leaf decoction is inhaled several times a day for treatment of flu. The leaf sap is applied topically to treat skin diseases. The essential oil from the leaves is used in the treatment of rheumatism, whooping cough and as a styptic. The essential oil from the leaves and hexane leaf extracts has shown antifungal activity against skin pathogens, which supports the use against skin diseases. A crude ethanol extract of the leaves has shown cytoxicity in a range of cancer cell lines, with cell death being due to apoptosis."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Trees are suitable as windbreaks. They are grown as a live fence. The plant makes an excellent hedge, and is much planted for this purpose in Guatemala. The hedges may be trimmed to any height and become very dense by continued pruning. Mexican cypress gives only limited protection against soil erosion. Pure stands on slopes or erosion-prone sites should be underplanted with other suitable species. Other Uses An essential oil obtained from the leaves, twigs and branches of the tree is used as an adjuvant and perfume in soaps, room sprays, deodorants and other products. Distillation of the leaves, twigs, fruits or flowers yields 0.05 - 3% essential oil; the reported compositions vary widely. The leaves are used to protect stored grain from insects. The heartwood is yellowish, pale brown, or pinkish, sometimes streaked or variegated; it is usually sharply demarcated from the 30 - 75mm wide band of white sapwood. The wood is of very fine and uniform texture; straight or irregular-grained; of rather high lustre, fragrant. It is light in weight; soft to hard; heavy; and of high durability. It saws well and is easy to work with hand and machine tools; it finishes well and has good nail-holding properties, but boring a clean hole is difficult; it stains and polishes well. It is highly esteemed for construction purposes and is used to make the sounding boards of guitars and mandolins, furniture, poles and posts. The wood makes a good fuel. An ornamental tree."@en .

Externally, it is applied as a diluted essential oil, having a slightly warming effect upon the skin and is thought to promote the removal of waste products from underlying tissues. It is, therefore, helpful when applied to arthritic joints etc. The fruits should not be used internally by pregnant women since this can cause an abortion.

The stems were at one time used as a strewing herb to sweeten the smell of rooms. The whole plant can be burnt as an incense and fumigant. It was used during epidemics in the belief that it would purify the air and cleanse it of infection. Fresh or dried juniper branches also make a good insect repellent. Many forms of this species are good ground cover plants for sunny situations. Forms to try include 'Depressa Aurea', 'Dumosa', 'Effusa', and 'Repanda'. 'Prostrata' can also be used. The bark is used as cordage and as a tinder. Wood - strong, hard, fragrant, very durable in contact with the soil and very close-grained, but usually too small to be of much use.

Plants can be grown as a ground cover, the cultivar 'Repens' is especially suitable. A fairly wind resistant tree, it can be grown as part of a shelterbelt planting. In N. America it is used to some extent in re-afforestation and shelterbelt plantings on the prairies.

  :plant_medicinal_text "American arbor-vitae was much used by many native North American Indian tribes as a medicine to treat fevers, coughs, headaches, swollen hands and rheumatic problems. The plant has an established antiviral activity and is most commonly used in modern herbalism to treat warts and polyps, being prescribed both internally and externally for these conditions. The plant can be used to induce menstruation and so should not be prescribed for pregnant women. The recently dried leafy young twigs are alterative, anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, aromatic, astringent, diaphoretic, diuretic and emmenagogue. The plant is being used internally in the treatment of cancer, especially cancer of the uterus. A tea made from the leaves is used in the treatment for bronchitis and other respiratory problems, colds, headaches and as a cough syrup. The plants diuretic properties make it useful in treating acute cystitis and bed-wetting in children. The leaves are used in steam baths in the treatment of rheumatism, arthritis, colds etc. Externally, the leaves are used as a wash for swollen feet and burns. Extracts of the leaves can be painted on painful joints or muscles as a counter0irritant, improving local blood supply and thus facilitating the removal of toxins, easing pain and stiffness. A tincture of the leaves has been used in the treatment of warts, piles, bed sores and fungal infections. The leaves and young twigs can be harvested as required and used fresh or dried. 'Oil of white cedar', obtained from the leaves, is an essential oil that is antiseptic, expectorant and rubefacient. It is used internally to promote menstruation and relieve rheumatism. This volatile oil is toxic and poisoning from overdoses has occurred, it should only be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner and should not be prescribed for pregnant women. The oil also stimulates the heart and causes convulsions in high doses. A tea of the inner bark is used to promote menstruation and in the treatment of consumption and coughs. A homeopathic remedy is made from the leaves and twigs, gathered when the tree is flowering. It is used in the household as a treatment against warts, but also has a range of other applications that should only be prescribed by a competent homeopath."@en ;
