  title: Deep Narrative Analysis RESTful APIs v1.3
  description: |-
    Defines the interface for ingesting, retrieving, editing and deleting 
    narratives and news articles using the Deep Narrative Analysis (DNA) 
    infrastructure.
    
    To use the API and for more information, refer to the README.txt file in 
    the [GitHub DNA repository](https://github.com/ontoinsights/deep_narrative_analysis).
    Note that this implementation assumes storage of graphs in a Stardog database.
    Environment variables define the location of that database (typically a 
    Stardog Cloud instance), and a username/password to access it (specially, 
    STARDOG_ENDPOINT, STARDOG_USER and STARDOG_PASSWORD). In addition,
    GEONAMES_ID and OPENAI_API_KEY environment variables MUST be set. If the 
    environment variables are not defined, DNA will not function.
    
    The following is a typical workflow after starting the DNA application:
    - Create a new repository by POSTing to
      /dna/v1/repositories?repository=repo_name, or an existing repository may 
      be reused
    - OR -
    - Use an existing repository (existing repositories are listed by 
      GETting /dna/v1/repositories)
    - THEN (optionally) - 
    - Add background details (people, places, businesses, 
      ...) by POSTing to 
      /dna/v1/repositories/background?repository=repo_name their 
      entity types
      - Adding background information improves processing time
        and assures better named entity resolution
      - Note that it is not necessary to input country names as
        background, since these details are already captured
    - It is also possible to review the background entities by
      GETting /dna/v1/repositories/background?repository=repo_name 
    - OR -
    - If an entity is incorrectly entered/typed, remove it by
      DELETEing the entry using
      /dna/v1/repositories/background?repository=repo_name&
      name=noun_name
    - THEN -
    - Ingest a narrative or news article by POSTing its metadata 
      and text to 
      /dna/v1/repositories/narrative-texts?repository=repo_name 
      with a request body holding the metadata details and full text
      (the response body will contain the narrative's id as stored in
      the repository)
      - Only English text articles are currently processed
      - Automated ingest will be supported in the future but many 
        sites require subscriptions which must be resolved 
    - OR - 
    - Determine which (already ingested) articles or narratives 
      are of interest by GETting 
      /dna/v1/repositories/narratives?repository=repo_name
      (the response body will contain a list of all narratives/articles
      and their metadata)
    - THEN -
    - Select articles to be analyzed/compared
      - Note that these APIs are currently under development
      
    To review the specific triples in a narrative or article, GET 
    /dna/v1/repositories/narratives/graphs?repository=repo_name&narrativeId=narr_id
    (the response body will contain a list of all triples).
    
    To update the triples or to add the narrative/article to another
    repository, POST to 
    /dna/v1/repositories/narratives/graphs?repository=repo_name&narrativeId=narr_id
    where the narrativeId must be the same id if updating in the original 
    repository, or can be any UNIQUE id if posting to a new repository. Note 
    that the request body must contain the complete list of triples.
      
    GETting /dna/v1/repositories or /dna/v1/repositories/narratives
    will return a list of all DNA repositories or all narratives/articles in
    a repository, respectively.
    
    DELETEing using the /dna/v1/repositories or /dna/v1/repositories/narratives 
    APIs will remove the specified repository or narrative/article. Please use 
    these commands with caution since the results are not reversible.
