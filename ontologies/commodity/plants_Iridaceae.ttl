  :plant_medicinal_text "The leopard lily has a very long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine. It is a bitter cooling herb that acts mainly on the lungs and the liver, lowering fevers and reducing inflammation. It is effective against a number of bacterial, fungal and viral organisms and has also been used as an antidote to snakebites. The root contains several medically active constituents including flavonoids and isoflavonoids. It also contains the glucosides belamcandin, tectoridin, shekanin and iridin. It is analgesic, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, depurative, expectorant, febrifuge, pectoral, purgative, stomachic and tonic. It is used in the treatment of acute laryngitis, acute tonsillitis, oedema of the glottis and cough with profuse sputum. The juice of the root is used in Nepal to treat liver complaints, where it has the added benefit of improving the appetite. This juice is also used to abort a foetus during the first trimester of pregnancy. The root should not be prescribed for pregnant women. The root is harvested in the summer and autumn, and dried for later use."@en ;

In modern herbalism it is mainly employed to detoxify the body - it increases urination and bile production and has a mild laxative effect. Some caution should be exercised in its use, however, since there are reports that it is poisonous. The fresh root is quite acrid and when taken internally causes nausea, vomiting, colic and purging. The dried root is much less acrid. This remedy should not be prescribed for pregnant women. The root is alterative, anti-inflammatory, cathartic, cholagogue, diaphoretic, diuretic, emetic and sialagogue. Taken internally as a tea, the root has been used as a strong laxative or emetic that also acts strongly on the liver and promotes the excretion of excess body fluids. It is also stimulant for the circulatory and lymphatic system. Its detoxifying effect make it useful in the treatment of psoriasis, acne, herpes, arthritis, swollen glands, pelvic inflammatory disease etc. Externally, it is applied to skin diseases, wounds and rheumatic joints. The roots are harvested in late summer and early autumn and are usually dried for later use.

It was believed that, so long as the root was handled occasionally to ensure the scent permeated the person and their clothes, rattlesnakes would not bite them. Some tribes even used to chew the root and then hold rattlesnakes with their teeth and were not bitten so long as the scent persisted."@en .
