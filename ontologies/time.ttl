  :definition "An interval of time in a Person's life, typically from birth to 12 years old." ;

  rdfs:label "Duration of Time" ;

:Interval a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :Time ;
  rdfs:label "Interval of Time" ;
  :definition "A period of time as defined by its beginning and end points in time, beginning point in time and duration, or end point in time and duration."; 
  :noun_synonym "timeframe", "period" .

:OldAge a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :Interval ;
  rdfs:label "Old Age" ;
  :definition "An interval of time in a Person's life, typically 60-65 years of age or older." ;

  :verb_synonym "be elderly", "be old", "be aged" .

:PointInTime a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :Time ;
  rdfs:label "Point in Time" ;
  :definition "A point in time as specified by the properties, :year, :day_of_month, :day_of_week, :hour_of_day, :minute_of_hour, :month_of_year, :second_of_minute and :week_of_month, or by a specific :date_time timestamp." ;
  :example "For example, April 1 2016 at noon can be specified by a PointInTime instance with the following properties and values: :year 2016, :month_of_year 4, :day_of_month 1 and :hour_of_day 12 or by the xsd:timestamp, '2016-04-01T12:00:00." ;
  :noun_synonym "moment", "instant" .

:RecurrencePattern a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :Time ;
  rdfs:label "Recurrence Pattern" ;
  :definition "Indicates a repeating point in time or repeating interval. Repetition is specified by indicating the overall start and end times of the pattern (via the :has_beginning and :has_end properties) and a time frame for recurrence. The latter is defined using the :has_recurrence_time property and/or by a separation interval between recurrences (indicated using the :separation_interval and :has_recurrence_unit properties). Note that if an end time is not defined, then the pattern is assumed to be ongoing. Also note that specific repetitions can be omitted/cancelled using the :omit_time property." ;
  :example "The possible semantics that can be expressed by RecurrencePattern are best illustrated using several examples. (1) The first example defines a pattern of the first Monday of every month for the years, 2018 and 2019. This would be specified using a :has_beginning property referencing January 2018 (a PointInTime with a :month_of_year property of 1 and a :year property of 2018) and a :has_end property referencing December 2019 (a PointInTime with a :month_of_year property of 12 and a :year property of 2019). The :has_recurrence_unit property would be set to :Months. The specific time of recurrence is defined using the :has_recurrence_time property and would reference another PointInTime instance with a :week_of_month property set to 1 (the first week of the month) and a :day_of_week set to 2 (Monday). (2) To indicate a recurrence every last Monday of the month for 2018 and 2019, all instances and property values would be defined as for (1) except that :week_of_month would be set to -1. (3) To indicate a recurrence every alternate Monday, most of the instances and property details from (1) would be valid except that :has_recurrence_unit would be :Weekly and the :week_of_month property would not be needed for the PointInTime instance referenced by the :has_recurrence_time property. However, the instance's :day_of_week property would still be set to 2. A separation_interval of 2 would be used to indicate 'alternate' weeks (every 2 weeks). (4) As a last example, consider a need to reference the rainy season(s) in some area. This would be accomplished by defining a RecurrencePattern instance with a :has_recurrence_unit of :Seasonal and a seasonal_description property set to 'rainy season'. (Other background information could be used to determine the months that are included in the 'rainy season' for the location.)" ;
  :noun_synonym "rhythm", "cadence", "cycle", "repetition" .

:Season a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :RecurrencePattern ;
  rdfs:label "Season" ;
  :definition "A time of year characterized by weather (rain, temperatures, etc.), amount of daylight, likelihood of an event occurring, etc. Seasons are defined differently in various localities and in different domains. For this reason, types of Seasons are specified as individuals as an 'open enumeration'." ;
  :example "Some locations utilize four weather seasons (summer, fall, winter and spring), while others have six seasons (prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, autumnal/fall and hibernal/winter), and still others have three seasons (rainy, dry and mild). In other places, season is defined by the occurrence of wildfires, hurricanes, or when plants grow. It is very possible for a Time at a Location to be associated with several seasons. Also, the various Seasons may have synonyms - such as the 'rainy season' instead being known as the 'monsoon season' in different parts of the world." .

:TeenAge a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :Interval ;
  rdfs:label "Teenage" ;
  :definition "An interval of time in a Person's life, typically from 13 through 19 years old." ;
