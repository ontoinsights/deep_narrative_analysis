This species has the same properties as other Typha species, but it is particularly suitable for exploitation owing to its enormous size. The report does not give any other information, but the general uses of other large Typha species are as follows:- Rhizomes - raw or cooked. A sweet flavour. Rich in starch, around 30 - 46%, they can be boiled and eaten like potatoes or macerated and then boiled to yield a sweet syrup. The rhizome can also be dried, ground into a powder and then used as a thickener in soups etc or added to cereal flours. Rich in protein, this flour is used to make biscuits, bread, cakes etc. The rhizomes at the base of erect shoots are mostly horizontal, unbranched, up to 70 cm long and 5 - 40mm in diameter. They are starchy, firm and scaly. The root contains a lot of fibre. One way to remove this fibre is to peel lengths of the root that are about 20 - 25cm long, place them by a fire for a short while to dry and then twist and loosen the fibres when the starch of the root can be shaken out. Young shoots in spring - raw or cooked. An asparagus substitute. The inner core is eaten. The young shoots are cut from the underground stems in the spring when they are about 10 - 40cm long. Base of mature stem - raw or cooked. It is best to remove the outer part of the stem. The base of the stem where it attaches to the rhizome can be boiled or roasted like potatoes. Young flowering stem - raw, cooked or made into a soup. Tastes like sweet corn. Seed - cooked. The seed is rather small and fiddly to utilize, but has a pleasant nutty taste when roasted. An edible oil is obtained from the seed. The seeds contain about 18 - 20% oil, of which 69% is linolenic acid. Due to the small size of the seed this is probably not a very worthwhile crop. Pollen - raw or cooked. A protein rich additive to flour used in making bread, porridge etc. It can also be eaten with the young flowers, which makes it considerably easier to utilize. The pollen is a bright yellow or green colour, and turns pancakes, cookies or biscuits a pretty yellow colour. The pollen can be harvested by placing the flowering stem over a wide but shallow container and then gently tapping the stem and brushing the pollen off with a fine brush.

Other Uses: This species has the same properties as other Typha species, but it is particularly suitable for exploitation owing to its enormous size. The report does not give any other information, but the general uses of other large Typha species are as follows:- The stems and leaves have many uses, they make a good thatch, being used on roofs, to make walls and floor coverings. They can be used in weaving to make items such as mats, chairs, hats and other handicrafts. They can be used as a caulking material for barrels, boats etc. A fibre obtained from the leaves and stems can be used in making paper. A fibre obtained from the roots can be used for making string. The plant produces large amounts of biomass, comparable to the most productive agricultural crops.This is a potential source of energy - it can, for example, be used for alcohol manufacture. On a domestic level, the stems make an excellent addition to the compost heap or can be dried and used as a source of fuel etc. The hairs of the fruits are used as a stuffing material for pillows, mattresses, toys etc. They have good buoyancy properties and have been used in life preservers. They also have excellent insulation properties and have been used in construction. The female flowers make an excellent tinder and can be lit from the spark of a flint. The pollen is highly inflammable and is used in making fireworks."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "The stems and leaves have many uses. Gathered in the autumn they make a good thatch, can be used in making paper, can be woven into mats, chairs, hats etc. They are a good source of biomass, making an excellent addition to the compost heap or used as a source of fuel etc. The pulp of the plant can be converted into rayon. The stems can be used to make rush lights. The outer stem is removed except for a small strip about 10mm wide which acts as a spine to keep the stem erect. The stem is then soaked in oil and can be lit and used like a candle. The female flowers make an excellent tinder and can be lit from the spark of a flint. A fibre is obtained from the blossom stem and flowers. A fibre obtained from the leaves can be used for making paper The leaves are harvested in summer, autumn or winter and are soaked in water for 24 hours prior to cooking. The fibres are cooked for 2 hours with soda ash and then beaten in a ball mill for 1½ hours. They make a green or brown paper. The hairs of the fruits are used for stuffing pillows etc. They have good insulating and buoyancy properties and have also been used as a wound dressing and a lining for babies nappies. The flowering stems can be dried and used for insulation, they also have good buoyancy properties. The pollen is highly inflammable, it is used in making fireworks etc."@en .
