U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney conceded defeat Tuesday in the Republican primary in Wyoming, an outcome that was a priority for former President Donald Trump as he urged GOP voters to reject one of his most prominent critics on Capitol Hill.

The race wasn’t close. Harriet Hageman, a water and natural-resources attorney who was endorsed by the former president, won 66.3% of the vote to Ms. Cheney’s 28.9%, with 95% of all votes counted.

Ms. Cheney was the last House Republican to face a primary among the 10 who voted to impeach Mr. Trump for his actions related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

“No House seat, no office in this land is more important than the principles we swore to protect,” Ms. Cheney said in her concession speech. “Our nation is barreling once again toward crisis, lawlessness and violence. No American should support election deniers.”

Ms. Cheney’s loss also marks a remarkable fall for a political family that has loomed large in Republican politics in the sparsely populated state for more than four decades. Her father is former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was elected to the House in 1978, where he served for a decade.
