  :definition "Legislation prohibiting disapproval of Hitler or the Nazi government. From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Malicious_Practices_Act_1933&oldid=956186689), 'the Malicious Practices Act was a measure introduced to rid the German state of its 'oppressors' and 'enemies'. In particular, the Nazi state imposed new legislation that made it illegal to speak wrongly of, or criticise the regime and its leaders. The two key guidelines were that of Protective Custody and Preventative Custody. Preventative Custody was aimed at the undesirables within society, for example paupers, homosexuals and Jews. Those who were unfortunate enough to fall into this category could be arrested even if an offence had not been committed. Homosexuality was a criminal offense in Weimar and Nazi Germany. Protective custody, however, was aimed at the regime's political opponents, in particular those from the left, such as the communists and the social democrats. The state made it apparent that those who failed to comply with Nazi ideology and politics could be arrested for the 'protection of the state'. In particular this was in an attempt to eliminate other political parties from German politics and eradicate their presence permanently.'" ;

Pressured by German army commanders, whose support Adolf Hitler needed to become President of Germany upon Paul von Hindenburg's impending death, Hitler used the SS to murder SA Chief of Staff Ernst Rohm and his top commanders on June 30–July 2. The SS also murders several present and past conservative critics of the Nazi regime including Hitler's predecessor as Chancellor, General Kurt von Schleicher, and the former Bavarian Minister-President, Gustav von Kahr. At Hitler's request, the German parliament (Reichstag) declares the killings legal after the fact, based on the false accusation that Rohm and his commanders had planned to overthrow the government." ;
