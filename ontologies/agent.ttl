:Affiliation a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :StateAndCondition ;
  rdfs:label "Affiliation" ;
  :definition "An Affiliation defines the (typically) long-term association of an Agent (the :affiliated_agent) to a Group, Organization, Location, etc. The individual to whom/which the Agent is associated is identified using the :affiliated_with property, while the time of the Affiliation can be specified using the :has_time property (or its subproperties) and the role that the Agent 'plays' is defined by the :has_role property. Another possibility to defining an Agent's role is to use the :role datatype property. This permits the capture of the role in the specific text/vocabulary of the narrative, whereas the :has_role property maps that text to an enumerated value." ;
  :example "Examples of Affiliations are a Person associated as an alumnus of their university, as an employee of a company or as a member of a religious or political group." .

:AgentAspect a owl:Class ;

In this case, the Person may be a member of another instance of Family that existed at a different time period. Note also that Family instances evolve over time with births, deaths, change of residence, etc. The time for which membership in a Family is relevant may be noted using the :has_time properties (or its sub-properties), and/or by indicating that one Family instance occurs :before another." ;
