:AdministrativeDivision a owl:Class ;

  rdfs:label "Administrative Division" ;
  :definition "A subnational level of government, operating over some region. The first-order administrative division is typically a state or province, but may be a territory or even a 'parish' in a smaller country. Other levels are defined below the first-order division - such as counties within states, districts within provinces, etc. The level of an AdministrativeDivision is given by the property, :admin_level. Note that :admin_level is an optional property and may not be known, or applicable." ;
  :synonym "county", "district", "govenorate", "municipality", "oblast", "parish", "prefecture", "principality", "province", "state", "territory" .

:AnthropogenicFeature a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :PhysicalLocation ;
  rdfs:label "Anthropogenic (Human-Created) Feature" ;
  :definition "A point or site on/in the Earth which is a human-created structure that is used for a particular industry or purpose. The specific location is identified by latitude/longitude/altitude, by name or street address, or by nearby points and sites." .

:Border a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :PhysicalLocation ;
  rdfs:label "Border" ;
  :definition "A boundary between two political, social or geographic entities. A Border may be identified by name, by the names of the bordering entities (using the :border_with property) or by a set of latitudes/longitudes (using the :has_location property to reference a set of PhysicalLocations with corresponding :latitutde/longitude properties)." ;
  :synonym "perimeter", "boundary" .

:BoundingRegion a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :PhysicalLocation ;
  rdfs:label "Bounding Region" ;
  :definition "A BoundingRegion is defined by at least three sets of latitude/longitude coordinates (instances of PhysicalLocation with :latitude/longitude properties) which enclose the region. The PhysicalLocations that define the points are referenced using the :has_bounding_coordinate property." .

:BuildingAndDwelling a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf :AnthropogenicFeature ;
  rdfs:label "Building and Dwelling" ;
