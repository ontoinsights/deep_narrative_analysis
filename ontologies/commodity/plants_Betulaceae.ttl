  :plant_medicinal_text "The bark and leaves have medicinal value, and have been used in the treatment of muscular and joint pain, rheumatism, skin infection, and as an anti-inflammatory. The macerated leaves are used to treat joint and muscular pains, rheumatism and skin infections. A leaf infusion is part of a cure for inflammation of the prostate."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: A pioneer species that grows rapidly, needs light, and regenerates in open areas. It tolerates a wide range of climates and soils. It can be used in reforestation projects at higher elevations in the Tropics. Both within its native range, as well as in other areas such as tropical Africa, the tree is increasingly planted for the reclamation of denuded sites, erosion control, soil improvement and in agroforestry systems. It is well suited for these purposes because of its rapid growth and tolerance to a wide range of soils and climatic conditions. It has been used as a shade plant for coffee in Costa Rica for about 100 years. Planting of this species in association with maize and corn can reduce the cost of planting these crops by up to 60%. The agroforestry benefits of this species are not derived only from its nitrogen fixing capabilities but also because of the leaves, which recycle nutrients into the soil. Other Uses: The inner bark yields tannin and dye. A brown dye is obtained from the bark. It is often used for cotton and other textiles. A match company in Colombia evaluated 20 species and found this species to be the best suited for making match sticks. The wood is used as a fuel. A traditional firewood, it burns evenly and very well. The calorific value is estimated at 19 250 kJ/kg. The wood is also used to make charcoal. The species is nitrogen fixing and the leaves are used as organic material in agricultural applications (as green manure) and as fodder material. The abundant wind-borne pollen is a valuable bee food supplement."@en .

Trees 5 years old from seed have reached 4 metres in height and are showing no signs of wind-shaping in a very exposed site in Cornwall. This is an excellent pioneer species for re-establishing woodlands on disused farmland, difficult sites etc. Its fast rate of growth means that it quickly provides sheltered conditions to allow more permanent woodland trees to become established. In addition, bacteria on the roots fix atmospheric nitrogen - whilst this enables the tree to grow well in quite poor soils it also makes some of this nitrogen available to other plants growing nearby. Alder trees also have a heavy leaf canopy and when the leaves fall in the autumn they help to build up the humus content of the soil.

A decoction of the dried bark is used to bathe swellings and inflammations, especially of the mouth and throat. The powdered bark and the leaves have been used as an internal astringent and tonic, whilst the bark has also been used as an internal and external haemostatic against haemorrhage. The dried bark of young twigs are used, or the inner bark of branches 2 - 3 years old. It is harvested in the spring and dried for later use. Boiling the inner bark in vinegar produces a useful wash to treat lice and a range of skin problems such as scabies and scabs. The liquid can also be used as a toothwash. The leaves are astringent, galactogogue and vermifuge. They are used to help reduce breast engorgement in nursing mothers. A decoction of the leaves is used in folk remedies for treating cancer of the breast, duodenum, oesophagus, face, pylorus, pancreas, rectum, throat, tongue, and uterus.

  :plant_other_use_text "Tolerant of clipping and maritime exposure, the alder can be grown in a windbreak or a hedge. The trees are very quick to establish and will grow at a rate of 1 metre or more per year when young. This is an excellent pioneer species for re-establishing woodlands on disused farmland, difficult sites etc. Its fast rate of growth means that it quickly provides sheltered conditions to allow more permanent woodland trees to become established. In addition, bacteria on the roots fix atmospheric nitrogen - whilst this enables the tree to grow well in quite poor soils it also makes some of this nitrogen available to other plants growing nearby. Alder trees also have a heavy leaf canopy and when the leaves fall in the autumn they help to build up the humus content of the soil. Alder seedlings do not compete well in shady woodland conditions and so this species gradually dies out as the other trees become established. Because they tolerate very poor soils and also produce nitrogen nodules on their roots, alders are suitable for use in land reclamation schemes. The plants can be used as a source of biomass. According to the phytomass files, annual productivity is estimated at 6 to 9 tonnes per hectare. The tree has yielded 11.8 tonnes per hectare per annum on pulverized fuel ash and annual productivity has been estimated at 8.66 tonnes per hectare, with 5.87 tonnes in wood, bark, and branches, 2.79 tonnes in foliage. Alder has been recommended for consideration for firewood plantations in Tropical highlands where unseasonable cold might destroy the red alder. The powdered bark has been used as an ingredient of toothpastes. Sticks of the bark have been chewed as tooth cleaners. An ink and a tawny-red dye are obtained from the bark. A green dye is obtained from the catkins. A pinkish-fawn dye is obtained from the fresh green wood. A yellow dye is obtained from the bark and young shoots. A cinnamon dye is obtained from the shoots if they are harvested in March. If they are dried and powdered then the colour will be a tawny shade. The bark and the fruits contain up to 20% tannin, but they also contain so much dyestuff (imparting a dark red shade) that this limits their usefulness. The leaves are also a good source of tannin. The leaves are clammy and, if spread in a room, are said to catch fleas and flies on their glutinous surface. Wood - very durable in water, elastic, soft, fairly light, easily worked, easily split. It is often used for situations where it has to remain underwater and is also used for furniture, pencils, bowls, woodcuts, clogs etc. It is much valued by cabinet makers. The wood also makes a good charcoal."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: Alnus jorullensis is an early successional species that regenerates and colonizes on open disturbed ground where other forest types have been destroyed though natural processes, such as landslides, or as a result of anthropogenic activities. It is used extensively in reforestation on disturbed sites and is widely grown in plantations throughout MesoAmerica and South America as a timber and fuel wood species. In agroforestry it is used in silvo-pastures to provide nitrogen for increasing forage availability and quality, to improve soil fertility, and it is grown in association with crops such as corn and beans, coffee and wild blackberries. Other Uses: The wood and bark is rich in tannin, which is used to impart a red colour. Woodland guides select this species for marking new trails through the mountain forests. The red marks of the bark cut by their machetes re as effective as red paint in marking the way. The wood is rather light and soft but firm, straight-grained, rather fine-textured, easy to work, tough and strong, finishes smoothly, is not durable in contact with the ground. It is used for the manufacture of boxes for transporting vegetables, shoe trees, matchsticks, post poles, broom handles, domestic implements, plywood cores and particle board. It is also locally harvested for firewood, and charcoal production. Used for ornamental planting in warm temperate areas such as southern California. Good for hedging and screening."@en .

The outer bark has also been used as emergency sun-glasses in order to prevent snow-blindness. A strip of bark 4 - 5cm wide is placed over the eyes, the natural openings (lenticels) in the bark serving as apertures for the eyes. A brown to red dye can be made from the inner bark. A pioneer species, it rapidly invades deforested areas (such as after a forest fire or logging) and creates suitable conditions for other woodland trees to follow. Because it cannot grow or reproduce very successfully in the shade it is eventually out-competed by the other woodland trees. The tree has an extensive root system and can be planted to control banks from erosion. The bark is a good tinder. An infusion of the leaves is used as a hair shampoo, it is effective against dandruff. The thin outer bark can be used as a paper substitute. It is carefully peeled off the tree and used as it is. A fibre is obtained from the inner bark and another from the heartwood, these are used in making paper. The heartwood fibre is 0.8 - 2.7mm long, that from the bark is probably longer. The branches of the tree can be harvested in spring or summer, the leaves and outer bark are removed, the branches are steamed and the fibres stripped off.
