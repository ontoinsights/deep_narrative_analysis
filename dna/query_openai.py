    '<Instructions: 1. Input Format: You are provided with the text (a complex sentence) that describes ' \
    'the situation. The sentence is followed by the string "**" which should be ignored. 2. A numbered list ' \
    'of event semantic categories are also provided. ' \
    '2. Situation Simplification: Break the complex sentence into simpler noun-verb or noun-verb-object sentences. ' \
    'Validate that all aspects of the sentence are captured in the set of simple sentences. Do NOT create a ' \
    'simpler sentence just to capture time-related information, but include the time in the appropriate simpler ' \
    'sentence. Make sure to capture the semantics of infinitive verbs and gerund phrases as separate, simple ' \
    'sentences. ' \
    'For each of the simpler sentences: a) Do NOT use any pronouns in the simpler sentences. Resolve ' \
    'pronouns to their specific references, and return the resolved text. b) Indicate if the simpler sentence uses ' \
    'future tense (true) or not (false). Determine this solely on the basis of the sentence text. ' + \
    f'c) List any modal verbs ("{modal_text}") that apply to the simpler sentence. d) Classify the semantics ' \
    f'of the sentence using the considerations in "Semantic Considerations". e) Provide the text of nouns that ' \
    f'have a semantic role of {semantic_role_text}. When providing the noun phrases and its semantic roles, ' \
    'follow the considerations in "Noun Text/Role Considerations". ' \
    '3. Semantic Considerations: a) Map each simpler sentence semantic to one or two of the numbered event/state ' \
    'categories provided in the input. Review all possible categories before selecting the most relevant ones. ' \
    '{subject_area_text} b) Make sure to consider each category and what it EXCLUDES. c) If the simpler sentence ' \
    'concerns emotions, sensory perception, communication/reporting, avoidance or agreement/disagreement about some ' \
    'topic, EXCLUDE the semantics of the topic from the mappings. d) Map only the exact semantics of the ' \
    'simple sentence. For example, the semantics of "Jane cannot tolerate lies" is about the lack of ability to ' \
    'tolerate lies and NOT an act of avoidance. ' \
    'e) Double check the mappings to validate that they are most relevant. f) When returning the mappings, return ' \
    'their numbers from the event categories list. g) Indicate whether the selected event categories match the ' \
    'meaning of the simpler sentence’s semantic ("same") or are the "opposite", accounting for negation in the ' \
    'sentence. h) Assign a correctness score (0-100) to indicate confidence in each mapping, where 0 indicates ' \
    'low confidence. i) If the sentence semantic involves an idiom, legal term, or legalese, make sure to use its ' \
    'idiomatic meaning in the mapping. j) If the sentence semantic is some kind of personal activity, such as ' \
    'exercising, washing or smoking, map it to the category, "bodily activity". k) For sentences with verbs based ' \
    'solely on the lemmas "be" or "become", assign category {description_number} ("description"). ' \
    'l) If no appropriate category is available, assign {other_number} ("other").> ' \
    '4. Noun Text/Role Considerations: a) Make sure to consider whether the simple sentence is in the active or ' \
    'passive voice when assigning the semantic role. b) Do NOT return articles in the text. c) Modify the text ' \
    'that is returned if the noun is a person and includes their proper name. ONLY return the person’s first ' \
    'and/or last names and validate that there are no adjectives, honorifics, titles, etc. d) Return ' \
    'the topic of a communication, sensory perception, emotion, avoidance or agreement/disagreement ' \
    'as a noun phrase with the "semantic role" of "theme". e) If the simple sentence describes a characteristic, ' \
    'attribute or role of an entity, such as a physical appearance, occupation, demographic, etc., return that ' \
    'characteristic/attribute/role with the semantic role of "theme" and return the described entity with the ' \
    'semantic role of "experiencer". f) Make sure to correctly define the semantic role when dealing with ' \
    'winning/losing. Specifically, if the sentence is concerned with a loss, the loser should have the semantic ' \
    'role of "agent", and the winner should have the role of "patient". If the sentence is concerned with a win, ' \
    'the winner has the role of "agent", and the loser has the role of "patient".> ' \
