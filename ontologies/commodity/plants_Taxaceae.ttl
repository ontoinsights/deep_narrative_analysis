The leaves have been used internally in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis, hiccup, indigestion, rheumatism and epilepsy. Externally, the leaves have been used in a steam bath as a treatment for rheumatism. A homeopathic remedy is made from the young shoots and the berries.

Unfortunately, the concentrations of taxol are rather low and the bark of 6 trees is required to provide enough taxol to treat one patient.

An infusion of the crushed leaves has been used externally as a wash to cause perspiration and effect a general improvement in the health. A poultice of the crushed leaves has been applied to wounds. A decoction of small woody pieces has been used in the treatment of internal complaints including stomach pains and blood in the urine. The leaves are harvested in early autumn or spring, the bark from autumn to spring, for commercial extraction of taxol. Ingestion of 50-100g of needles can cause death."@en ;

The root is very strong and is particularly good for hopper mortar baskets. Wood - fine-grained, strong, hard, heavy, durable and resilient, taking a very fine polish. Though hard, the wood is easy to carve. It is also used for making paddles, fence posts and various other small articles."@en .
