The leaves are expectorant and a bronchial sedative. They are best harvested in the spring and can be dried for later use. The resin is antiseptic, balsamic, diuretic, eupeptic, expectorant, vasoconstrictor and vulnerary. Both the leaves and the resin are common ingredients in remedies for colds and coughs, either taken internally or used as an inhalant. The leaves and/or the resin are used in folk medicine to treat bronchitis, cystitis, leucorrhoea, ulcers and flatulent colic. The resin is also used externally in bath extracts, rubbing oils etc for treating rheumatic pains and neuralgia. Oil of Turpentine, which is obtained from the trunk of the tree, is occasionally used instead of the leaves or the resin.

The resin extracted from it is used in perfumery, medicine and for caulking ships. It is called 'Strasburg Turpentine'. Oil of turpentine is an important solvent in the paint industry. The residue, known as 'rosin oil', is used in making varnishes, lacquers and carbon black (for pigments and ink). Resin is tapped from trees about 60 - 80 years old in the spring and used for the distillation of oil. An essential oil obtained from the leaves is used as a disinfectant and also in medicine and perfumery. It is a common ingredient in many bath products, giving them their familiar pine scent. The bark is a source of tannin. Wood - light, soft, durable, elastic.

  :plant_other_use_text "The balsamic resin 'Balm of Gilead' or 'Canada Balsam' according to other reports is obtained during July and August from blisters in the bark or by cutting pockets in the wood. Another report says that it is a turpentine. The term Canada Balsam is a misnomer because balsams are supposed to contain benzoic and cinnamic acids, both absent from the Canada oleoresin. Turpentine is also a misnomer, implying that the oleoresin is entirely steam volatile. Actually it contains 70 - 80% resin, only 16 - 20% volatile oil. Canada Balsam yields 15 - 25% volatile oil, the resin being used for caulking and incense. It is used medicinally and in dentistry, also in the manufacture of glues, candles and as a cement for microscopes and slides - it has a high refractive index resembling that of glass. The pitch has also been used as a waterproofing material for the seams of canoes. The average yield is about 8 - 10 oz per tree. The resin is also a fixative in soaps and perfumery. 'Turpentine' is usually collected during July-August by breaking the turpentine blisters into small metal cans with sharp-pointed lids. Trees are then allowed to recuperate for 1 - 2 years before being harvested again. The leaves and young branches are used as a stuffing material for pillows etc - they impart a pleasant scent and also repel moths. The leaves contain an average of 0.65% essential oil, though it can go up to 1.4% or even higher. One analysis of the essential oils reports 14.6% bornyl acetate, 36.1% b-pinene, 11.1% 3-carene, 11.1% limonene, 6.8% camphene, and 8.4% a-pinene. To harvest the oil, it would appear that the branches should be snipped off younger trees in early spring. Fifteen year old trees yield 70% more leaf oil than 110-year-old trees; oil yields are highest in January - March and September, they are lowest from April to August. A thread can be made from the roots. Wood - light, soft, coarse grained, not strong, not very durable. Weighs 24lb per cubic foot. Used mainly for pulp, it is not used much for lumber except in the manufacture of crates etc. The wood is commercially valuable for timber even though it is relatively soft, weak, and perishable. Balsam fir is used in the US for timber and plywood, and is the mainstay of the pulp wood industry in the Northeast. The wood, which is rich in pitch, burns well and can be used as a kindling"@en .

It has also been used as a red paint on jars and bowls. For waterproofing containers, the gum was melted and poured inside the container. The container was then turned round to ensure the gum came into contact with all parts of the inside. More gum would then be applied to the outside. The resin has been used as a glue for fixing turquoise in jewellery. The gum has been used, with sumac leaves (Rhus spp) and yellow ochre to make a black dye and ink. The sumac leaves are boiled until there is a strong mixture. Whilst the sumac was boiling, the ochre was powdered and roasted. The gum was then added to the ochre and the whole roasted again. As the roasting proceeded, the gum melted and finally the mixture was reduced to a black powder. This was then cooled and thrown into the sumac mixture, forming a rich blue-black fluid that was essentially an ink. Wood - light, soft, not strong, brittle. Used for fuel, fencing etc. A charcoal made from the wood is used in smelting. The wood makes a good fuel, burning with few sparks being thrown out."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Oleoresin is tapped from the trees and distilled to obtain 12 - 13% turpentine and rosin. Turpentine is used in the paint industry. Rosin is used in the production of paper, soap and glue. An essential oil is distilled from the needles. The leaves yield around 0.3% of a balsam scented oil. The main components are alpha-pinene (43.0%), beta-pinene (27.1%) and alpha-terpineol (9.6%). The heartwood is yellow to red-brown; it is not clearly demarcated from the 5 - 15cm wide band of yellowish white sapwood. The grain is straight, sometimes spiral; texture medium; growth rings are distinct. The wood is heavy, hard, tough, moderately durable to non-durable, being susceptible to attacks by Anobium borers, marine borers and termites. The resin content of the wood is high. The wood dries with little degrade, although some surface checking and splitting down the centre may occur. The wood is relatively difficult to work; resin may adhere to sawteeth and cutting edges, but the use of long-pitched sawteeth reduces this problem; it holds nails and screws well; glues, finishes and paints satisfactorily. The lightweight and soft wood from younger trees is mainly used for pulping, whereas the heavier and harder wood of older trees is used as timber. The straightness of the bole makes it particularly suitable for poles, piles and solid-wood products, but treatment with preservatives is often necessary. The wood is also suitable for construction, flooring, frames, joinery, interior trim, furniture, cabinet work, ship and boat building, vehicle bodies, toys, turnery, boxes, crates, veneer, plywood and particle board. The wood is used for fuel. Carbon Farming (Pinus elliottii and Pinus elliottii x caribea) - They can be used as an industrial crop - hydrocarbon and for agroforestry services as a windbreak."@en .

  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: A pioneer species, its natural range is extended by colonization following disturbances such as fire. It grows, for instance, scattered in fire-prone grassland and woodland. The trees are increasing in number in recently disturbed areas. The tree is often used for the rehabilitation of degraded areas because of its tolerance to fire and poor soil conditions. The tree has been successfully intercropped with Irish potatoes. The tree is used to shade out alang-alang grass with fairly good results. The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat. Other Uses A good quality oleoresin is collected from this species, often on a plantation scale. The species is a high resin yielder and commercial tapping is often practised. The resin is used in paints, medicines, printing and the perfumery industry. The resin-rich wood is used as torches. The heartwood is yellowish to orange brown with dark red veins and numerous resin canals, darkening on exposure to light; it is clearly demarcated from the 2 - 5cm wide band of whitish to creamy white sapwood. The texture is moderately coarse; the grain straight; the surface lustrous when freshly cut but becoming dull with age; there is a resinous odour and a faint resinous taste. The wood is moderately heavy; soft to moderately hard; fairly durable and not easily rotting in the soil according to some reports, but non-durable and liable to termite attack according to others. It seasons quickly with little risk of checking or distortion; once dry it is moderately stable in service. The wood saws easily and works to a good finish, though resins may clog cutters and tools. The timber is a general-purpose softwood, useful for light construction, joinery, window frames, door frames, flooring, furniture, matches, chop-sticks, paper pulp, long fibre pulp, pit props, transmission poles, ship- and boat construction, vehicle-building, containers, boxes. The wood is used for fuel and to make charcoal. Industrial crop: hydrocarbon"@en .

The lustre is medium; the grain straight; texture somewhat fine and uniform. The wood is easy to work with hand and machine tools. The wood is less prone to splitting and warping than that of most other pines and therefore highly valued for the production of sawn timber. The heartwood is classified as very durable in resistance to attack by white-rot fungus, and moderately durable when exposed to a brown rot. The wood does not weather well without the protection of paint or other coatings. It is used as a general-purpose timber and for pulp. The handsome, very pale, yellowish wood is much used for all kinds of construction, and also for furniture. The wood is used for fuel and kindling.

They are used internally for their mildly antiseptic effect within the chest and are also used to treat rheumatism and arthritis. They can be added to the bath water for treating fatigue, nervous exhaustion, sleeplessness, skin irritations. They can also be used as an inhalant in the treatment of various chest complaints. The essential oil from the leaves is used in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory infections, and also for digestive disorders such as wind. An essential oil obtained from the seed has diuretic and respiratory-stimulant properties. The seeds are used in the treatment of bronchitis, tuberculosis and bladder infections.

  :plant_other_use_text "A tan or green dye is obtained from the needles. The needles contain a substance called terpene, this is released when rain washes over the needles and it has a negative effect on the germination of some plants, including wheat. Oleo-resins are present in the tissues of all species of pines, but these are often not present in sufficient quantity to make their extraction economically worthwhile. The resins are obtained by tapping the trunk, or by destructive distillation of the wood. In general, trees from warmer areas of distribution give the higher yields. Turpentine consists of an average of 20% of the oleo-resin and is separated by distillation. Turpentine has a wide range of uses including as a solvent for waxes etc, for making varnish, medicinal etc. Rosin is the substance left after turpentine is removed. This is used by violinists on their bows and also in making sealing wax, varnish etc. Pitch can also be obtained from the resin and is used for waterproofing, as a wood preservative etc. Wood - light, soft, close-grained. It is occasionally made into lumber and is also used for general carpentry."@en .

A pitch (called hemlock pitch), is obtained by distillation of the young branches. 'Oil of Hemlock' is distilled from the young branches according to another report. The bark contains 8 - 14% tannin. The inner bark is used according to one report. The inner bark has been used in making baskets. A red to brown dye is obtained from the bark. A red dye is obtained from the inner bark according to another report. A little rock dust has been added to act as a mordant when boiling the bark. The boiled bark has been used to make a wash to clean rust off iron and steel, and to prevent further rusting. Tolerant of light trimming, plants can be grown as a hedge. This species does not make a good hedge in Britain. Some cultivars can be grown as a ground cover when planted about 1 metre apart each way. 'Pendula' is slow-growing but makes a very good cover. Wood - coarse-grained, light, soft, not strong, brittle, not durable outdoors. Difficult to work because it splits easily. The wood weighs 26lb per cubic foot. The trees do not self-prune and so the wood contains numerous remarkably hard knots that can quickly dull the blade of an axe. A coarse lumber, it is used occasionally for the outside of buildings. It should be used with caution as a fuel for outdoor fires because it can project embers and burning wood several metres from the fire."@en .
