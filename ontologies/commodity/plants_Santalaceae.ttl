Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers  well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils.

  :plant_medicinal_text "The bark is widely used as a medicine in west Africa and is also exported to Europe and other countries. It is particularly employed in the treatment of skin disorders and poisoning. Six different catechins have been isolated from the bark, including (+)-catechin and (+)-gallocatechin, as well as_-sitosterol and stigmasterol. The bark has antimicrobial and immunostimulating properties that are attributed to phenolic compounds. A macerate of the bark is used in the treatment of tachycardia. The bark is used in phytotherapeutic medicine in the Western world. Its main applications are for stomach upsets caused by poisoning and to boost the system in cases of tiredness, depression and allergies. Skin problems, including those caused by syphilis and leprosy, are treated by washing with, or bathing in a macerate or infusion of the bark in water. External application of bark preparations is also practised to counteract poisoning. A bark macerate is taken as a vapour bath or as nose drops to cure oedema. In a compress it is used to disperse haematomas. A wooden tool is traditionally used for the removal of the bark, and under no circumstances is a metal implement used."@en ;

Field studies indicate that only 1 - 5% of the seeds germinate. The rate of germination is higher in reserves and protected research and plantation areas, but is still less than 20%. Establishment of the plant on an operational and plantation scale can be achieved by sowing 4 seeds per spot in well drained sites, 50 - 70 mm below the soil and mulching in a small depression at the drip line of the south side of a suitable host plant. The seedlings tend to die if their roots fail to attach to suitable hosts. The deaths therefore may be due to the inability to obtain some type of element for which the host is essential or the inability to take up sufficient nutrients to maintain growth."@en .
