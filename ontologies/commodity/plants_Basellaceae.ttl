  :plant_edible_text "Tuber - cooked. Starchy and mucilaginous. The tubers can be up to 8cm long. Ulluco is a staple food in South America, being used in most of the ways that potatoes are used, indeed when boiled and fried they taste very much like potatoes. In the Andes a popular dish called 'chuño' is made by alternately freezing and drying the tubers. The tubers contain about 14% carbohydrate, 1 - 2% protein, almost no fat or fibre. They are fairly rich in vitamin C, about 23mg per 100g fresh weight. The tubers store well and will last up to 12 months in cool conditions. Leaves - raw or cooked. Mucilaginous and not that exciting. They contain about 12% protein dry weight."@en ;
