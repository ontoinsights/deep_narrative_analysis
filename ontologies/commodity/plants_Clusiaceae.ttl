Recently, the international food industry has become interested in the fat as a natural solid component for margarines and similar products. The seeds contain a fat that is solid at ambient temperatures. The kernel, which makes up about 60% of the seed, contains about 72% fat. The fatty acid composition of the fat is approximately: stearic acid 45 - 58% and oleic acid 40 - 51%. Only traces of other fatty acids are present. Its composition and relatively high melting point (35°c) makes the fat a valuable raw material that can be used without transformation to improve the consistency of margarines, cocoa butter substitutes and similar products. Fruits are stored under a cover of leaves to allow the fruit pulp to disintegrate. To extract the seeds, fruits are crushed between the hands and seeds are rubbed clean. To extract the fat, seeds are dried and crushed; the resulting mass is mixed with water and boiled until the fat separates and floats to the surface, from where it is scooped off. More modern hydraulic and screw press equipment is now also used. The seeds are eaten in times of food scarcity. The fruit’s slimy pulp can be made into jams and jellies. The fruit is large, up to 30cm long by 10cm in diameter with upward of 100 seeds borne within in a translucent mucilage."@en ;

The grain is fairly straight, texture medium to coarse; the lustre is low. The wood is fairly hard, fairly durable, and moderately resistant to termites. It is resistant to marine borers. When dry it saws well, but green wood may spring on conversion. It is fairly easy to work with hand and machine tools. It is used locally, but is of secondary importance. In Nigeria it is used in construction of local houses."@en .

They are orange-sized, and contain a yellow pulp surrounding four seeds."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "Bitter kola is widely used in traditional medicine in Africa with most parts of the plant being used and a wide range of ailments being treated. Several medically active compounds have been identified. Tannins, a reducing sugar and traces of an alkaloid have been detected in the bark; flavonins are also present, the whole being extremely bitter, resinous and astringent. A number of pharmocological actions have also been demonstrated. Extracts of stems, roots and seeds have been shown to have strong anti-hepatotoxic and hepatotropic activity. Petroleum ether and acetone extracts were found to be markedly anti-microbial. The bark contains an abundant sticky resinous gum. This is taken internally in the treatment of gonorrhoea. Externally, the gum is applied to skin-infections and used to seal new wounds. The bark is said to be aphrodisiac, galactagogue. A decoction is used to treat female sterility and to ease child-birth, the intake being daily until conception is certain and then at half quantity throughout the term. It is also used to induce the expulsion of a dead foetus. The powdered bark is applied externally to malignant tumours, cancers, etc.. A tea of the bark, combined with the bark of Sarcocephalus latifolius, has a strong reputation as a diuretic, urinary decongestant and treatment for chronic urethral discharge. The bark, combined with Piper guineense and sap from a plantain stalk (Musa sp.) is used to embrocate the breast for mastitis. The seed and bark are taken to treat stomach-pains. The leaves and bark are used in the treatment of pulmonary and gastro-intestinal troubles. The root and bark are used as a tonic for men 'to make their organs work well'. The leaves have a bitter taste. A leaf-infusion is purgative The fruits are eaten in Nigeria as a cure for general aches in the head, back, etc., and as a vermifuge. The seeds are said to be antidote, antitussive, aphrodisiac, astringent and vermifuge. Mastication of the seeds is said to relieve coughs, hoarseness, and bronchial and throat troubles. They are taken dry as a remedy for dysentery. They are said to provide an antidote against Strophanthus poisoning. The active principle, or principles, in the nut remain enigmatic. Caffeine, which is present in the true kola, is absent. A trace of alkaloid has been reported in Nigerian materials, but absent in other samples. Tannins are present which may contain the anti-bacterial compounds morellin and guttiferin. Activity may also lie in resins which are as yet unidentified."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Agroforestry Uses: The tree is used to provide shade in cocoa plantations. Other Uses: The bark contains an abundant sticky resinous gum that has water-proofing properties. It can be used to protect powder in the priming pans of flintlock guns from rain. The gum in the bark is incendiary, the twigs burning brightly and therefore used as tapers. The bark is used in tanning, and has at times been exported as a tanning material. The leaves have a bitter taste and are used as a deterrent to fleas. The sap-wood is creamy white, the heart-wood yellow, darkening to brown at the centre, hard, close-grained, finishing smoothly and taking a good polish. It is durable and fairly resistant to termites. The principal application of the wood is for chew-sticks. They are said to whiten the teeth and clean the mouth, and are widely used in western Africa. Smaller trees are more commonly used and are specifically felled for this purpose, the wood being cut and split into pencil-sized pieces. The roots are also used as chew sticks, sometimes in preference to the wood. They are believed to prevent dental caries, though tests have shown no anti-biotic activity."@en .

The rind of partially ripe fruits yields a polyhydroxy-xanthone derivative termed mangostin. That of fully ripe fruits contains the xanthones, gartanin, 8-disoxygartanin, and normangostin. A derivative of mangostin, mangostin-e, 6-di-O-glucoside, is a central nervous system depressant and causes a rise in blood pressure A decoction of the leaves and bark is used as an astringent, febrifuge and to treat thrush, diarrhoea, dysentery and urinary disorders. A bark extract called 'amibiasine', has been marketed for the treatment of amoebic dysentery An infusion of the leaves, combined with unripe banana and a little benzoin, is applied to the circumcision wound. A root decoction is taken to regulate menstruation."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Small fruit tree, Humid shade garden, Bonsai, Botanic collection. Other Uses The fruit rind is a source of tannins. It contains 7 - 14% catechin tannin and rosin. The tannins can be used as a black dye. The twigs are used as chewsticks. The fruit hulls show anti-fungal and anti-protozoal activity. The dark-brown wood is strong; heavy to the point that it almost sinks in water; and is moderately durable. Usually only available in small sizes, it has been used in construction and cabinetwork, to make handles for spears and rice pounders."@en .

  :plant_edible_text "Fruit - raw or cooked to make sherbet, ice cream, marmalade or jelly. The white, pithy pulp has a pleasant odour and an agreeable, subacid flavour. The fruit is yellow when ripe, nearly round or ovoid, 75 - 125mm wide, weighing up to 900 g. The rind is yellow, hard, fleshy on the inside, 1 - 2 cm thick, and contains gummy, yellow, resinous latex. The infertile seed compartments are filled with pulp called 'filho 'which is the part preferred."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The seeds contain 6 to 11% of an oil that is mixed with sweet almond oil and used to treat eczema and herpes. The bark is astringent. A decoction is used to treat diarrhoea."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other Uses: A non-drying oil, known as 'bakuri oil', is obtained from the seed. It is used for the manufacture of candles and soap. A fibre obtained from the bark is used for cordage. A black, viscous resin obtained from the bark is used for caulking boats. The heartwood is dull-yellow to orange-brown with many fine, dark, often black streaks; it is clearly demarcated from the 3 - 9cm wide band of yellowish-white sapwood. The texture is coarse to medium; the grain generally straight but at times irregular; the lustre is low. The wood is heavy; moderately hard to hard; moderately strong; elastic; durable in the soil and resistant to dry-wood borers and termites. It seasons somewhat slowly, with a high risk of checking and distortion; once dry it is poorly stable in service. It has a fairly high blunting effect, stellite-tipped and tungsten carbide tools are recommended; although hard, it is easy to work with both hand and power tools; nailing and screwing are good, but require pre-boring; gluing is correct for interior purposes only; it polishes well. It is valued for construction, high class furniture, flooring, ship-building and general carpentry."@en .
