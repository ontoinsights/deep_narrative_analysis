  :plant_edible_text "Fruit - raw or cooked. Dessert forms are sweet and succulent when fully ripe and are widely eaten out of hand, though they are very versatile and are used in a wide variety of other ways. For example, they are commonly used with other juicier fruits to make smoothies, they can be baked, cooked in cakes, dried for later use etc. Plantains are richer in starch and contain less sugars. Whilst these are more commonly cooked as a vegetable, when fully ripe they make a very acceptable raw fruit. Male inflorescences are eaten in curries or cooked with coconut milk. The inner stem can be boiled and eaten, or can be dried and made into a flour and starch. Blanched shoots that sprout from the base can be roasted and eaten. The leaves are commonly used for wrapping foods that are to be cooked - especially glutinous rice dishes. They impart a distinctive flavour and a greenish colour. Nectar of the flowers is consumed. The ashes of the plant can be used as a salt substitute."@en ;
