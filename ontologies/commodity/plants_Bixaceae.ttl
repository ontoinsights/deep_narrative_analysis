  :plant_physical_characteristics "Bixa Orellana is an evergreen Tree growing to 5 m (16ft) by 4 m (13ft) at a fast rate. It is hardy to zone (UK) 10 and is frost tender. The flowers are pollinated by Bees.  Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers  well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils. It can grow in  semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers  moist soil and can tolerate drought."@en ;

  :plant_edible_text "Edible portion: Seeds, Spice. The seeds are relatively tasteless. They are briefly steeped in hot oil which is then strained and cooled to be used as a flavouring in various dishes. The whole seeds can be ground into a paste with various other spices, which gives a more pronounced flavour. The seeds have a high nutritive value, containing a small amount of fatty oil (5%) and about 13% of protein. The ground seed is red and this can be used to colour foods. A yellow colour is obtained from the seed coat, and this is widely used as a colouring in margarines etc in the food industry. It is a harmless, non-carcinogenic dye . It colours butter, margarine, cheese, and chocolate. It is ground and used as a spice (Annatto) in South America."@en ;
  :plant_medicinal_text "The medical properties of annatto are poorly understood, but it is a bitter, astringent, purgative herb that reputedly destroys intestinal worms, lowers fever, improves digestion and has expectorant effects. A decoction of the leaves is used as a treatment for dysentery, and to reduce vomiting during pregnancy. The leaves are applied to the head and to sprains to relieve aches. A decoction is gargled as a cure for mouth and throat infections. The leaves may also be used in baths to relieve muscular aches, fevers, colic or to get rid of worms in children. The fresh shoots are steeped in water, which is then used as a eyewash for inflamed eyes. The leaves can be picked as required and used fresh or dried. The sap from the leaf petiole is soaked in hot water with rum, then used to remove secretions from encrusted eyelids as a treatment for blepharitis. Young shoots are applied locally as a poultice on abscesses. The roots are digestive and diuretic. A decoction is taken orally to control asthma. An infusion of the root in water and rum is used to treat venereal diseases. A tea made from the root is used to treat oliguria and jaundice. The seeds are used as an aphrodisiac, emmenagogue, expectorant and vermifuge. They are used to treat asthma and nasal cavity problems. A macerated seed decoction is taken orally for the relief of fevers. In a syrup, they are used in the treatment of pharyngitis and bronchitis. The ground seeds are applied to burns in order to prevent blistering and scarring. The seeds are harvested as the fruits split open, and can be dried for later use. They can also be soaked in hot water - the resulting sediment is pressed into cakes for use in medicines and dyes. The pulp surrounding the seed is made into an astringent drink used to treat cancer, dysentery and kidney infections. The fruit pulp is used as a rub on the skin to prevent sores, probably from sunburn. The dye obtained from the seed coat is used as an antidote for prussic acid poisoning caused by eating poorly treated Manihot esculenta. Sap from the bark and crushed leaves is used as a treatment for skin rashes. A decoction of the bark is used as a treatment for malaria; angina and asthma. The leaves contain cyanidine and ellagic acid."@en ;
  :plant_other_use_text "Other uses rating: High (4/5). Small flowering tree, Dye plant, Planter, Accent, Flower Border, Screening, Conservatory. Suitable for growing indoors. Agroforestry Uses: The plant is amenable to pruning and can be grown as a hedge. Plants are tolerant of hard trimming. Other Uses A red dye, known as annatto, is obtained from the fruit. The dye is obtained from the seed coat. The dye is used to colour cloth, and is also used by native people as a cosmetic for painting the skin and as a lipstick. It is also used in the cosmetic production of nail gloss, hair oil, lipstick and soap, as well as in the production of floor wax, furniture and shoe polish. The colour rapidly fades when exposed to light and air. A waxy substance that has paralytic action on mammalian intestinal parasites is present in the seed coat. Bixin extracted from the seed coat is used in India as an insect repellent. The red dye obtained from the seed is applied to the skin to repel mosquitoes and other biting insects. Annatto paste filters out the ultraviolet rays of sunlight, thereby protecting the skin from excessive sunburn. The bark from the branches of the trees yields a water-soluble gum that is similar to gum arabic. The seeds contain a characteristic pleasant-smelling essential oil. It is said that fire can be started by the friction of 2 pieces of the soft wood. A fibre for cordage has been obtained from the bark of the tree. The sapwood is whitish and the heartwood light brown or yellowish. The wood is soft, light in weight (specific gravity 0.4), porous, weak and not durable. The stems and branches are used for fuel."@en .
